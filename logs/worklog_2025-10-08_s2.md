## Worklog for Session 2 (2025-10-08)

**Summary of Actions and Decisions:**

This session focused on a significant refactoring and feature enhancement of the PKM linking utility, driven by the user's decision to migrate from BibTeX to BibLaTeX and to implement a more robust keyword linking system.

**1. BibLaTeX Migration:**
    *   **Decision:** Migrate from `bibtexparser` to `pybtex` and `latexcodec` for BibLaTeX parsing.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Updated `requirements.txt`: Removed `bibtexparser`, added `pybtex`, `latexcodec`.
        *   Installed new dependencies into the virtual environment.
        *   Updated `specs/spec.md`: Modified `FR-001` and Acceptance Scenario 1 to reflect BibLaTeX and `pybtex` usage.
        *   Updated `specs/tasks.md`: Added `Phase 1.5: BibLaTeX Migration` and marked tasks `T007a`, `T007b` as complete.
        *   Modified `create_author_json.py`: Rewrote the script to use `pybtex` for parsing and `Person` objects for author processing.
        *   **Verification:** Successfully ran `create_author_json.py`, generating `authors.json`.

**2. Keyword Generation & Linking Refinement:**
    *   **Decision:** Shift from YAML frontmatter parsing for keywords to a single flat term file, with robust alias and piped link generation.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Updated `specs/spec.md`: Rewrote `FR-006` through `FR-010` (Keyword Generation Requirements) and `FR-012` (Linking Requirements) to specify parsing a single term file, extracting aliases (including from parentheses), resolving conflicts by prioritizing longer `LinkTarget`s, and generating piped links (`[[LinkTarget|Alias]]`).
        *   Updated `specs/tasks.md`: Modified tasks `T008`, `T009`, `T014`, `T017` to align with the new keyword generation and linking logic.
        *   **Phase 1: Setup & Project Structure:**
            *   `T001`: Created `src/pkm_linker/` directory.
            *   `T002`: Added `python-frontmatter` and `python-dotenv` to `requirements.txt` and installed them.
            *   `T004`: Created `config.yaml` (from `config.example.yaml`) and added `term_source_file` key.
        *   **Phase 2: Tests First (TDD):**
            *   `T008`: Created `tests/test_generate_keywords.py`.
            *   `T009`: Wrote a failing test case for the new keyword generation logic, including alias extraction and conflict resolution.
        *   **Phase 3: Core Implementation & Refactoring:**
            *   `T013`: Created `src/pkm_linker/generate_keywords.py`.
            *   `T014`: Implemented the keyword generation logic in `src/pkm_linker/generate_keywords.py`.
            *   **Verification:** Ran `tests/test_generate_keywords.py`, which passed.
            *   `T015`, `T016`: Moved `create_author_json.py` and `link_authors.py` to `src/pkm_linker/`.
            *   `T017`: Moved `link_keywords.py` to `src/pkm_linker/` and updated its `process_markdown_file` function to implement the piped link format `[[LinkTarget|Alias]]`.
            *   `T018`, `T019`: Updated `main.py` to import modules from `src/pkm_linker/` and added the `--generate-keywords` argument.
        *   **Phase 4: Polish & Documentation:**
            *   `T023`: Added docstrings and type hinting to `src/pkm_linker/generate_keywords.py`.
            *   `T024`: Updated `README.md` with the new workflow and CLI usage, including an explanation of keyword linking.
            *   `T025`: Created `src/pkm_linker/smart_link.py` as a placeholder for future LLM logic.
    *   **Bug Fix & Re-generation:**
        *   **Issue:** User identified a flaw in `generate_keywords.py` where aliases were not always correctly mapped to the most descriptive `LinkTarget`.
        *   **Fix:** Modified `generate_keywords.py` to ensure that for any given alias, it always maps to the longest, most descriptive `LinkTarget`, regardless of processing order.
        *   **Verification:** Re-ran `main.py --generate-keywords`, confirming correct generation of `keyword-mapping.csv` with all aliases properly mapped.

**3. New Phase 5 Plan (Two-Stage & Smart Linking):**
    *   **Decision:** Implement a hybrid approach for ambiguous terms: simple linking for unambiguous terms, and LLM-powered contextual analysis for ambiguous ones.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Added `Phase 5: Two-Stage & Smart Linking` to `specs/tasks.md`, detailing tasks `T029` through `T039` for this new feature.
