## Worklog for Session 1 (2025-10-14)

**Session Goal:** Reorient the automated linking roadmap toward context-aware, cluster-driven processing and capture the pivot in our planning docs.

---

### 1. Specification Updates
- Expanded acceptance criteria in `specs/spec.md` to require topic cluster metadata, note-level classification, filtered linking, and dry-run capability.
- Added new functional requirements covering cluster catalogues, context detection, safe boundary enforcement, and LLM-backed disambiguation.
- Documented the initial cluster catalogue (education-learning, construction-built_environment, technology-computing, etc.) and the new `TopicCluster` entity.

### 2. Roadmap Restructure
- Reworked `specs/tasks.md` Phase 5 onward into a multi-phase plan:
  * Phase 5 – define taxonomy and enrich keyword outputs with cluster metadata (now completed).
  * Phase 6 – build the classifier (LLM or rules) and CLI hooks for contextual analysis.
  * Phase 7 – implement filtered linking with robust boundary checks and dry-run workflow.
  * Phase 8 – fold clusters into the smart-link pipeline with caching/reporting.
  * Phase 9 – validation suite, runbook, and rollout documentation.

### 3. Implementation Progress
- `src/pkm_linker/generate_keywords.py` now infers provisional clusters and writes them to both unambiguous and ambiguous outputs.
- `tests/test_generate_keywords.py` updated to assert cluster metadata is present.
- Regenerated `unambiguous-keywords.csv`/`ambiguous-keywords.json` with the new schema; confirmed totals unchanged (822 unambiguous, 6 ambiguous).
- `config.example.yaml` extended with `cluster_catalogue_file` and classifier settings scaffold.


### 4. Next Steps Agreed
1. Elevate the provisional heuristics into a curated cluster catalogue file and wire the generator to read explicit metadata.
2. Prototype the context classifier interface and dry-run reporting before touching real notes (Phase 6/7 groundwork).
3. Keep test fixtures (`_helper/test/…`) isolated until the safer linker is ready.

**Verification:**
- `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- `python3 main.py --generate-keywords`
