## Worklog for Session 1 (2025-10-14)

**Session Goal:** Reorient the automated linking roadmap toward context-aware, cluster-driven processing and capture the pivot in our planning docs.

---

### 1. Specification Updates
- Expanded acceptance criteria in `specs/spec.md` to require topic cluster metadata, note-level classification, filtered linking, and dry-run capability.
- Added new functional requirements covering cluster catalogues, context detection, safe boundary enforcement, and LLM-backed disambiguation.

### 2. Roadmap Restructure
- Reworked `specs/tasks.md` Phase 5 onward into a multi-phase plan:
  * Phase 5 – define taxonomy and enrich keyword outputs with cluster metadata.
  * Phase 6 – build the classifier (LLM or rules) and CLI hooks for contextual analysis.
  * Phase 7 – implement filtered linking with robust boundary checks and dry-run workflow.
  * Phase 8 – fold clusters into the smart-link pipeline with caching/reporting.
  * Phase 9 – validation suite, runbook, and rollout documentation.

### 3. Next Steps Agreed
1. Design the initial cluster taxonomy and update the keyword generator/tests to emit metadata (Phase 5).
2. Prototype the context classifier interface and dry-run reporting before touching real notes (Phase 6/7 groundwork).
3. Keep test fixtures (`_helper/test/…`) isolated until the safer linker is ready.

**Verification:** No code execution or file mutations beyond spec/task documentation edits. SC inside `git status` shows only planning files changed.
