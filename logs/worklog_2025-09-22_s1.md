# Worklog: 2025-09-22, Session 1

## Session Goal
To analyze the existing project, establish a clear development process, define the project's scope and features in a formal specification, and prepare for future development.

## Summary of Activities

This session involved a comprehensive review and structuring of the `regex-tag` project. We transitioned from a collection of individual scripts to a more cohesive application structure with clear documentation and a plan for future work.

### 1. Initial Analysis and Project Refactoring
- **Project Analysis**: I began by analyzing the directory structure and reading the `README.md` and key source files (`create_author_json.py`, `link_authors.py`, `link_keywords.py`, `config.yaml`).
- **Assessment**: We determined the project was a functional but "piecemeal" collection of scripts. We decided to unify them.
- **CLI Refactoring**: I created a central `main.py` script using `argparse` to act as a single entry point for running all processing steps (`--generate-authors`, `--link-authors`, `--link-keywords`, `--all`).
- **Bug Fix**: I identified and fixed a bug in `link_authors.py` where it was not correctly loading the `authors.json` filepath from the `config.yaml`.

### 2. Establishing New Collaboration Rules
- To ensure clarity and prevent missteps, we established a new rule: I must now present a clear plan of action and receive your explicit approval before executing any file modifications or commands.

### 3. Formalizing the Project Specification (`spec.md`)
- **Directory Creation**: You created the `/specs` directory and templates.
- **Initial Spec**: I generated a detailed `specs/spec.md` file based on the provided template and our understanding of the project.
- **LLM Integration**: We discussed integrating a local or cloud-based LLM for "smart linking" to handle contextual disambiguation. We decided to include this as a future feature in the spec, with API keys to be managed via a `.env` file.
- **Keyword Generation Process**: You clarified the process for generating keywords, which was a major update to the project scope.
    - Keywords are defined in individual `.md` files in an Obsidian vault.
    - These files contain YAML frontmatter (`term`, `aliases`).
    - A new script would be needed to parse these files and generate the `keyword-mapping.csv`.
- **Spec Update**: I updated `specs/spec.md` to reflect this detailed keyword generation workflow, adding new functional requirements and user scenarios.

### 4. Session Management
- We decided to implement a session logging mechanism to ensure continuity. This involves creating a `worklog_YYYY-MM-DD_sN.md` file in a `/logs` directory at the end of each session.

## Key Decisions
- The project will be managed through a unified `main.py` CLI.
- All new features and changes will be documented in `specs/spec.md` before implementation.
- API keys for future LLM features will be stored in a `.env` file, and `.env` is already present in `.gitignore`.
- The `keyword-mapping.csv` will be programmatically generated from a directory of term-definition Markdown files.
- All sessions will be logged in the `/logs` directory.

## Project State at End of Session
- The codebase is refactored for unified CLI access.
- A comprehensive feature specification (`specs/spec.md`) is in place.
- A `logs` directory has been created for session worklogs.
- The project is well-documented and ready for the next phase of development: creating a `tasks.md` or beginning implementation of the keyword generation script.
