## Worklog for Session 3 (2025-10-13)

**Session Goal:** Move into Phase 5 of the roadmap by splitting keyword processing into unambiguous vs. ambiguous outputs, wiring the CLI to use the new structure, and standing up the LLM-based smart-link fallback.

---

### 1. Configuration & Infrastructure Updates
* Added `src/pkm_linker/config_loader.py` to centralise configuration parsing with a YAML fallback so the CLI keeps working even if `PyYAML` is unavailable.
* Updated `config.yaml` / `config.example.yaml` to swap `keywords_csv_file` for the new `unambiguous_keywords_csv` + `ambiguous_keywords_json` keys; pointed `tag_extract.py` at the new default output.
* Extended `main.py` to read its paths from config, expose a `--smart-link` flag, and ensure the `--all` workflow now runs the smart linker after the simple linker.

### 2. Keyword Generation Enhancements
* Reworked `generate_keywords.py` to:
  * Expand punctuation variations (hyphen, slash, em dash, etc.) for every alias.
  * Group aliases into unambiguous vs. ambiguous sets (using `defaultdict(Set)` accumulators).
  * Emit both `unambiguous-keywords.csv` and `ambiguous-keywords.json`, including provenance (`source_terms`) for ambiguous rows.
* Regenerated artifacts with the new pipeline (`python3 main.py --generate-keywords`), producing 807 unambiguous mappings and 6 ambiguous entries.

### 3. Test & Linker Adjustments
* Updated `tests/test_generate_keywords.py` to assert creation and contents of both outputs, including verifying that “MIT” lands in the ambiguous JSON.
* Pointed `link_keywords.py` at the unambiguous CSV and refactored it to reuse the shared config loader.
* Confirmed the regressions pass with `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.

### 4. Smart Linking Implementation
* Replaced the placeholder `smart_link.py` with a full pipeline:
  * Loads ambiguous entries, extracts local context, and calls OpenAI via a pluggable analyser (with caching).
  * Gracefully handles missing dependencies (`python-dotenv`, `openai`) and absent API keys, emitting guidance instead of crashing.
  * Writes contextual links back into Markdown only when the LLM selects a candidate; leaves content untouched otherwise.
* Added `openai` to `requirements.txt` and verified the CLI fallback message (`python3 main.py --smart-link`) when no API key is configured.

### 5. Documentation & Planning
* Refreshed `README.md` to describe the two-stage keyword process and the optional smart-link pass.
* Updated `specs/spec.md` acceptance criteria and requirements to reference the new artifacts.
* Marked Phase 5 tasks `T029`–`T036` complete and revised `T009` wording in `specs/tasks.md`.

### 6. Outstanding / Next Steps
1. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) in the active environment and supply `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optional `OPENAI_MODEL`) in `.env`.
2. Update `scan_directories` and `term_source_file` to point at the real vault before running `python3 main.py --all`.
3. When ready, rerun `--smart-link` to validate contextual linking on live data and capture outputs in the next session log.
