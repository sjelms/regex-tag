    """
    Parses a term file and generates a CSV mapping aliases to link targets.

    This function reads a flat text file where each line is a term. It processes
    these terms to create a mapping from various aliases to a canonical link target,
    which is the term as it appears on the line (matching a filename).

    - Reads a flat list of terms.
    - The full line is the LinkTarget (filename).
    - Extracts aliases from parentheses, e.g., "Term (Alias)".
    - Resolves alias conflicts by prioritizing longer, more descriptive LinkTargets.

    Args:
        term_file_path (str): The absolute path to the input term list file.
        csv_output_path (str): The absolute path for the output CSV mapping file.
