                 Praxis highlights wide variances in the opportunities available
                 to employees to learn and develop, even within jobs that are

              ever-changing cultural and technological environment. Teaching is
              now a design science. Like other design professionalsaOCo
              architects, engineers, programmers OCo teachers have to work out
              creative and evidence-based ways of improving what they do. Yet
              teaching is not treated as a design profession. Every day,
              teachers design and test new ways of teaching, using learning
              technology to help their students. Sadly, their discoveries often
              remain local. By representing and communicating their best ideas
              as structured pedagogical patterns, teachers could develop this
              vital professional knowledge collectively. Teacher professional
              development has not embedded in the teacherOCOs everyday role the
              idea that they could discover something worth communicating to
              other teachers, or build on each othersOCO ideas. Could the
              culture change? From this unique perspective on the nature of
              teaching, Diana Laurillard argues that a twenty-first century
              education system needs teachers who work collaboratively to design
              effective and innovative teaching.``",

               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as *offsite construction*. A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both

               researchers who study the transformation of practice through the
               enhancement and transformation of expertise. This is an important
               moment for such a contribution because expertise is in transition
               - moving toward collaboration in inter-organizational fields and
               continuous shaping of transformations. To understand and master
               this transition, powerful new conceptual tools are needed and are
               provided here. The theoretical framework which has shaped these
               studies is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). CHAT
               analyses how people and organisations learn to do something new,
               and how both individuals and organisations change. The
               theoretical and methodological tools used have their origins in
               the work of Lev Vygotsky and A.N. Leont’ev. In recent years this
               body of work has aroused significant interest across the social
               sciences, management and communication studies. Working as part
               of an integrated international team, the authors identify
               specific findings which are of direct interest to the academic
               community, such as: the analysis of vertical learning between
               operational and strategic levels within complex organizations;
               the refinement of notions of identity and subject position within
               CHAT; the introduction of the concept of ‘labour power’ into
               CHAT; the development of a method of analysing discourse which
               theoretically coheres with CHAT and the design of projects.
               Activity Theory in Practice will be highly useful to
               practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who are
               interested in conceptual and empirical issues in all aspects of

                 education systems, and their form, goals, and practices, are
                 increasingly shaped by institutional factors, which Dewey
                 (1916) refers to as the ?social side.? They extend to the
                 provision of detailed national prespecified outcomes, course
                 content, forms of assessment, and so on. Yet, the efficacy and
                 continuity of these educational provisions arise in response to
                 how individuals engage, learn, and remake them?what Dewey
                 refers to as the ?personal side??albeit in interdependent ways.
                 That is, there is mutual dependence between the personal and
                 social sides. Regardless of whether it is directed to pragmatic
                 purposes or educational efficacy, vocational education relies
                 on individual experiencing and engagement, interdependently.
                 Ultimately, individuals enact vocational education provisions,
                 learn from and through them, prompt changes within them, and

                 of the German dual system. It focuses on the relationship

                 These transformations are going to fundamentally change all

                 will also have substantial influences on vocational education

                 how these technologies can be used to effectively support
                 learning and teaching processes in this educational field. We

                 expertise is used, developed, and sustained (over time) in
                 practice. It argues that the development of teachers? expertise
                 in vocational contexts is a complex, diffuse, and largely
                 hidden process, residing both within the individual as personal
                 expertise and/or within networks as shared vocational
                 knowledge. The chapter employs two different but complementary
                 research methodologies (cultural historical activity theory and
                 actor?network theory) as analytical lenses to explore and make
                 visible the phenomenon of vocational practice in action.
                 Examples are given from a range of case studies of both
                 vocational trainee teachers and experienced vocational
                 teachers. The chapter concludes by arguing for new ways to

                 relationship with apprenticeship. The discussion draws on two

               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this
               groundbreaking text, as it gives the intellectual tools required
               to understand how learning in the workplace can be improved.",

               low-wage workers, both employed and unemployed, effected through
               the widespread use of ‘basic skills’ assessments. Employers are
               increasingly using literacy, numeracy and language skills
               assessments as the basis of hiring decisions as well as a range
               of other employment decisions, including promotion, assignment or
               reassignment, and firing. Assessment is used in ‘workplace basic
               skills’ programmes, both in the ‘needs assessment’ phase prior to
               the establishment of programmes and in the post-programmes
               ‘learning assessment’ phase. In the workplace, the unequal nature
               of the employment relationship and the requirement for programmes
               of education or training to have a measurable impact on
               profitability tend to conflict with the need for the
               dispassionate and unthreatening assessment required in programmes
               of fundamental education. This tendency has been magnified in the
               recent past as performance on literacy, numeracy and language
               proficiency assessments has been interpreted as a consummate
               indicator of ‘fitness’ for work. The chapter concludes that the
               use of ‘basic skills’ assessments represents an area of
               fundamental conflict between capital and labour and that, in
               cases where training programmes are designed to remediate basic
               skills ‘deficiencies’, the quality of the training itself is
               frequently as problematic as the assessment.",

               are acquired and used. In particular, performance in the

               forms of knowledge and skill, under conditions that allow little
               time for the analytic/deliberative approach favoured in higher
               education. One consequence is greater reliance on tacit
               knowledge, including knowledge of how more formal, explicit
               knowledge is used in various practice settings. The second half

               understanding and positive commitment from individual learners,
               formal education, employers and local workplace managers.

               attainments of such learning. Drawing upon empirical data, we

               complex, yet a research focus on measured attainments implicitly
               defines such learning in a narrow way, within an acquisition
               perspective. This severely restricts the range of learning that
               can be recognized. Ironically, the very types of learning likely
               to be excluded are some of the most common and significant. To
               gain a better understanding of workplace learning and to
               effectively improve it, we need to resist scientific

                 has moved to the forefront of public conversation, in a
                 practical sense training and development have become more of an
                 industrial relations concern, as policymakers exhort the social
                 actors to cooperate and build new partnership relations around
                 skills, training, and learning to help address the challenges
                 of building more productive economies. The chapter considers
                 the conceptual underpinnings of the industrial relations of
                 training, before reviewing developments in the British training
                 system, notably in terms of trade union?led learning
                 initiatives, within a more comparative context. The analysis
                 suggests that the industrial relations of training are heavily

                 help to regulate potential conflicts of interest around

               leader took the ideas in this book seriously, the world would be
               a less miserable, more productive place.'' Every organization is
               plagued by destructive friction. Yet some forms of friction are
               incredibly useful, and leaders who attempt to improve workplace
               efficiency often make things even worse. Drawing from seven years
               of hands-on research, The Friction Project by bestselling authors
               Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao teaches readers how to become
               ``friction fixers.'' Sutton and Rao kick off the book by
               unpacking how skilled friction fixers think and act like trustees
               of others' time. They provide friction forensics to help readers
               identify where to avert and repair bad organizational friction
               and where to maintain and inject good friction. Then their help
               pyramid shows how friction fixers do their work, from reframing
               friction troubles they can't fix right now, so they feel less
               threatening, to designing and repairing organizations. The heart
               of the book digs into the causes and solutions for five of the
               most common and damaging friction troubles: oblivious leaders,
               addition sickness, broken connections, jargon monoxide, and fast
               and frenzied people and teams. Sound familiar? Sutton and Rao are
               here to help. They wrap things up with lessons for leading your

               things; the power of civility, caring, and love for propelling

               overview of prefabricated and modular housing. The idea of
               prefabricated and modular housing is not a new one: since the
               19th century, designers, inventors, engineers, builders,
               developers, and entrepreneurs have all been fascinated by the
               idea of the factory-built home. But the current international

              the physical world is three-dimensional, most data is trapped on
              two-dimensional pages and screens. This gulf between the real and
              digital worlds prevents us from fully exploiting the volumes of
              information now available to us. Augmented reality, a set of
              technologies that superimposes digital data and images on physical
              objects and environments, is closing this gap. By putting
              information directly into the context in which we’ll apply it, AR
              increases our ability to absorb and act on it. AR will become the
              new interface between humans and machines, say Michael E. Porter
              of Harvard and James E. Heppelmann, the CEO of the industrial
              software maker PTC. Many people are familiar with AR entertainment
              applications, such as Snapchat filters, but AR is being applied in
              far more consequential ways in business. Pioneering organizations
              are already implementing it in product development, manufacturing,
              logistics, marketing, service, and training—and are seeing major
              gains in quality and productivity. AR improves how users visualize
              information, receive and follow instructions, and interact with
              products. AccuVein, for instance, uses AR technology that converts
              the heat signature of a patient’s veins into an image superimposed
              on the skin, making them much easier to locate. Boeing uses AR to
              show trainees how to assemble an aircraft wing—and has cut the
              time it takes them to do that task by 35\%. At GE, factory workers
              have achieved a similar gain in efficiency by using voice commands
              in AR experiences to perform complex wiring. AR will have a wide
              impact on how companies compete. This article walks readers
              through the questions firms need to ask when integrating it into
              their strategies and operations. The article also includes HBR’s
              first embedded AR experiences, which readers can launch by
              downloading a new HBR app on their mobile devices and then

               companies that produce parts for global car manufacturers. These
               companies have introduced competence-based approaches in order to
               audit and assess the skills of their workforces in response to
               demands from the companies they supply that they can prove their

               The paper argues that a competence-based approach can be

                 which way the additional demand for wooden construction
                 material shall be fulfilled. Here we assess the global and

                 land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an
                 open-source land system model. We show that if 90\% of the new
                 urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise
                 buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2
                 could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to expand

                 forests would increase. Our results indicate that expansion of

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.",

               Driven to Distraction sparked a revolution in our understanding
               of attention deficit disorder. Widely recognized as the classic
               in the field, the book has sold more than a million copies. Now a
               second revolution is under way in the approach to ADD, and the
               news is great. Drug therapies, our understanding of the role of
               diet and exercise, even the way we define the disorder - all are
               changing radically. And doctors are realizing that millions of
               adults suffer from this condition, though the vast majority of
               them remain undiagnosed and untreated. In this new book, Drs
               Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey build on the breakthroughs
               of Driven to Distraction to offer a comprehensive and entirely
               up-to-date guide to living a successful life with ADD. As
               Hallowell and Ratey point out, 'attention deficit disorder' is a
               highly misleading description of an intriguing kind of mind.
               Original, charismatic, energetic, often brilliant, people with
               ADD have extraordinary talents and gifts embedded in their highly
               charged but easily distracted minds. Tailored expressly to ADD
               learning styles and attention spans, Delivered from Distraction
               provides accessible, engaging discussions of every aspect of the
               condition, from diagnosis to finding the proper treatment regime.
               Inside you'll discover: - whether ADD runs in families - new
               diagnostic procedures, tests, and evaluations - the links between
               ADD and other conditions - how people with ADD can free up their
               inner talents and strengths - the new drugs and how they work,
               and why they're not for everyone - exciting advances in
               nonpharmaceutical therapies, including changes in diet, exercise,
               and lifestyle - how to adapt the classic twelve-step program to
               treat ADD - sexual problems associated with ADD and how to

               living in the world. It only becomes a disorder when it impairs

               have triumphed, Delivered from Distraction is a wise, loving
               guide to releasing the positive energy that all people with ADD

               both childhood and adult diagnosis of ADHD is the potential
               upside: many hugely successful entrepreneurs and highly creative

               are the recent research developments, including innovations that

               behaviour assessments to discover the work, activity, or creative
               outlet best suited to an individual's unique strengths. -
               Reimagine environment. What specific elements to look for - at
               home, at school, or in the workplace - to enhance the creativity
               and entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the ADHD mind. - Embrace
               innate neurological tendencies. Take advantage of new findings
               about the brain's default mode network and cerebellum, which
               confer major benefits for people with ADHD. - Tap into the
               healing power of connection. Tips for establishing and
               maintaining positive connection, 'the other Vitamind C', and the
               best antidote to the negativity that plagues so many people with

               pharmaceutical options. As inspiring as it is practical, ADHD 2.0

               real enemy isn’t productivity or focus, but the toxic ADHD core
               beliefs we’ve internalised. With candour and kindness, they share
               personal stories to highlight and reframe the 10 big lies that
               ADHD people believe about themselves. From ‘I am lazy’ to
               ‘Everybody hates me’ and ‘I quit everything I start’, Small Talk
               will empower ADHDers and those who love them to navigate life
               with compassion, humour and hope. Whether you were diagnosed

               change your relationship with yourself and others. It will help
               you to stop being your worst fear-leader, start bigging yourself

               shame-free guide, the creator of the award-winning YouTube
               channel How to ADHD shares the hard-won insights and practical
               strategies that have helped her survive, even thrive, in a world
               not built for her brain. “The world of ADHD has been waiting for
               this book with bated breath for many years. If there’s a fairy
               godmother of our lot, it’s Jessica McCabe.”—Edward Hallowell, MD,
               coauthor of Driven to Distraction and ADHD 2.0 Forget “try
               harder.” When your brain works differently, you need to try
               different. Diagnosed with ADHD at age twelve, Jessica struggled
               with a brain that she didn’t understand. She lost things
               constantly, couldn’t finish projects, and felt like she was
               putting more effort in than everyone around her while falling
               further and further behind. At thirty-two years old—broke,
               divorced, and living with her mom—Jessica decided to look more
               deeply into her ADHD challenges. She reached out to experts,
               devoured articles, and shared her discoveries on YouTube. In How
               to ADHD, Jessica reveals the tools that have changed her life
               while offering an unflinching look at the realities of living
               with ADHD. The key to navigating a world not built for the
               neurodivergent brain, she discovered, isn’t to fix or fight
               against its natural tendencies but to understand and work with
               them. She explains how ADHD affects everyday life, covering
               executive function impairments, rejection sensitivity,
               difficulties with attention regulation, and more. You’ll also
               find ADHD-specific strategies for adapting your environment,
               routines, and systems, including: • Boost the signal and decrease
               the noise. Facilitate focus by putting your goals where you can
               see them and fighting distractions with distractions. • Have less
               stuff to manage. Learn why you have trouble planning and
               prioritizing, and why doing more starts with doing less. • Build
               your “time wisdom.” Work backward when you plan, and track how
               long it actually takes you to do something. • Learn about your
               emotions. Understand how naming your emotions and letting
               yourself experience them can make them easier to regulate. With
               quotes from Jessica’s online community, chapter summaries, and
               reading shortcuts designed for the neurodivergent reader, How to
               ADHD will help you recognize your strengths and challenges,
               tackle “bad brain days,” and be kinder to yourself in the

               interviewing: (a) How do you do it? and (b) How do you analyze

               theory methods shape qualitative interviewing in relation to
               personal narratives and guide analysis of interview data.
               Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible
               strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data
               collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of inductive
               steps that successively lead the researcher from studying
               concrete realities to rendering a conceptual understanding of
               them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney G. Glaser and
               Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop middle-range theories
               from qualitative data. Hence they not only intended to
               conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to demonstrate
               relations between conceptual categories and to specify the
               conditions under which theoretical relationships emerge, change,

               recommendations for shadowing as a method of organizational study
               with a focus on the situated processes and practices of shadowing
               fieldwork. Design/methodology/approach– This paper reflects on
               the shadowing experiences of three researchers – in a hospital
               emergency department, nuclear power plants, and entrepreneur
               workspaces – to generate recommendations by identifying and
               synthesizing solutions that emerged during the encounters with
               the challenges and opportunities in shadowing. Findings–
               Considering shadowing as an ongoing and emergent research process
               can be helpful to prepare for particular aspects of shadowing
               fieldwork. Shadowing presents research challenges that may emerge
               in the practice of fieldwork, including how to negotiate awkward
               conversations with participants, what to bring and wear, and how
               to take notes. Practical implications– Though the recommendations
               for shadowing are based on particular experiences and may not
               generalize to all shadowing engagements, they offer concrete,
               practical recommendations useful across experience levels. The
               recommendations should sensitize researchers to the intimate and
               situational character of shadowing, and offer strategies for
               coping with the distinctive requirements of shadowing.
               Originality/value– By looking across diverse experiences of
               shadowing, the paper generated guidelines that help to make sense
               of shadowing processes, manage uncertainty in the field, and
               build on the emerging work on shadowing. The ten recommendations
               provide insight into shadowing that are of particular value to
               graduate students, junior researchers, and those new to
               shadowing. Moreover, the experienced shadower may find value in
               the camaraderie of shared experience, the concrete ideas about
               another's experience of shadowing, and insight in recommendations
               that capture aspects of fieldwork that they are also exploring.",

               it seeks to outline and elaborate the nature of the project of
               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues

               Experience Research, Yahoo!I love Observing the User Experience!
               This comprehensive guide approaches user experience research like
               never before, and is well-written, easy-to-read, and quite user
               friendly. It provides a real-world example of how research is
               done in just enough detail that it can both inform a CEO of the
               role of usability research as well as introduce methodology to

               Usability Manager, Ebay The gap between who designers and
               developers imagine their users are, and who those users really
               are can be the biggest problem with product development.
               Observing the User Experience will help you bridge that gap to
               understand what your users want and need from your product, and
               whether they'll be able to use what you've created.Filled with
               real-world experience and a wealth of practical information, this
               book presents a complete toolbox of techniques to help designers
               and developers see through the eyes of their users. It provides
               in-depth coverage of 13 user experience research techniques that
               will provide a basis for developing better products, whether
               they're Web, software or mobile based. In addition, it's written
               with an understanding of how software is developed in the real
               world, taking tight budgets, short schedules, and existing
               processes into account.Features and benefits:·Explains how to
               create usable products that are still original, creative, and
               unique·A valuable resource for designers, developers, project
               managers-anyone in a position where their work comes in direct
               contact with the end user.·Provides a real-world perspective on
               research and provides advice about how user research can be done
               cheaply, quickly and how results can be presented
               persuasively·Gives readers the tools and confidence to perform

               the Reagan Labor Board in 1983. Empirical analysis shows that the

                 workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as
                 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include
                 the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of
                 training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards;
                 (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance
                 and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively
                 low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in
                 improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace
                 training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the
                 importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of
                 workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards
                 those at the top of the occupational hierarchy; (7) Much of the
                 qualitative evidence shows that learning occurs naturally in
                 all workplaces as part of everyday activity in line with the
                 learning as participation approach; (8) Workplace learning
                 takes many forms stretching across a 'formal-informal'
                 continuum; (9) International research evidence suggests that
                 the key inter-related determinants in the variability of
                 workplace learning environments are context and individual
                 behaviour; and (10) External recognition and accreditation of
                 workplace learning is problematic due to its largely collective
                 and dynamic nature.",

               VET research is concerned with exploring continuity as well as

               change and continuity might require a more substantive and

               whether VET researchers are sufficiently concerned with the life

               suggests that it is time for some recalibration of the way VET
               research is conceived and organized in order to have a broader
               influence on policy and practice at both a national and

               role of small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in promoting
               and/or hindering educational opportunities to adult employees in
               the UK.Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws on 12 case
               studies of SMEs in England and Scotland, which form part of a
               larger European Sixth Framework Programme research project.
               Interviews were conducted with employers, line managers and
               employees participating in formal educational programmes, and
               were contextualized with policy documents and literature on
               lifelong learning and workplace education.Findings– This paper
               highlights and explores findings related to human resource
               management (HRM) and the participation of employees in formal
               education, and the experiences of companies in providing
               educational opportunities to employees in England and Scotland.
               The paper argues that employers have a key role to play in
               driving and investing in employee training and development.
               However, the current focus of employers on formal educational
               opportunities appears narrowly focused on job‐specific, in‐house
               training.Originality/value– The paper's value lies in its
               illustration of the restricted focus of the lifelong learning
               policy agenda on the development of human capital, which not only
               limits the development of portable skills and qualifications for
               employees, but also undermines the broader aims of lifelong
               learning.",

              particular contexts making it highly suited to flexible, multiple
              perspective methodologies, such as case study. However, case study
              methodology is often criticized for being too specific, not
              generalizable and limited in what it can contribute to theory. In
              addition, there is often confusion between the meaning and
              application of the terms method and methodology. This paper
              presents an argument to help guide and support researchers who are
              considering a case study approach to their WIL research. Two
              vignettes demonstrate how researchers overcame some of the alleged
              limitations of case study as a methodology and utilized the
              benefits to advance the theory and practice of WIL. Case study
              provides a sound methodology that can reflect the variability of
              research contexts and enables a flexible approach to address a
              wide range of research questions that are relevant to the evolving

  abstract  = "[John Dewey and L. S. Vygotsky share similar ideas concerning the
               relationship of activity and learning/development, especially the
               roles everyday activities and social environment play in the
               educational process. However, the two theorists are far apart in
               their conception of the relationship between process and goals in
               education. Dewey concentrates on means in education, believing
               that it is the ability of the individual to question through
               experience that is most important for the human community.
               Vygotsky, while recognizing the importance of (especially
               cultural) process in education, sees social and cultural goals as
               being integrated into social pedagogy. This paper compares Dewey
               and Vygotsky on three key points that relate directly to
               educational processes and goals. First, the two theorists are
               compared on the role of social history and the tools it produces.
               Dewey sees social history as creating a set of malleable tools
               that are of use in present circumstances. Vygotsky believes that
               tools developed through history have a far more lasting impact on
               the social community. Second, the two theorists are compared in
               their conceptualizations of experience/culture. Dewey sees
               experience as helping to form thinking, whereas Vygotsky, in his
               cultural historical theory, posits culture as the raw material of
               thinking. Third, the two theorists are compared on their
               perspectives on human inquiry. Dewey sees the child as a free
               agent who achieves goals through her own interest in the
               activity. Vygotsky suggests there should be greater control by a
               mentor who creates activity that will lead the child towards
               mastery. These differences are then explored in terms of how they
               might impact actual classroom strategies and curriculum.]",

  publisher = "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)",
  abstract  = "In tandem with the diffusion of computer technologies, labour
               markets across the OECD have undergone rapid structural
               transformation. In this paper, we examine i) the impact of
               technological change on labour market outcomes since the computer
               revolution of the 1980s, and ii) recent developments in digital
               technology – including machine learning and robotics – and their
               potential impacts on the future of work. While it is evident that
               the composition of the workforce has shifted dramatically over
               recent decades, in part as a result of technological change, the
               impacts of digitalisation on the future of jobs are far from
               certain. On the one hand, accumulating anecdotal evidence shows
               that the potential scope of automation has expanded beyond
               routine work, making technological change potentially
               increasingly labour-saving: according to recent estimates 47
               percent of US jobs are susceptible to automation over the
               forthcoming decades. On the other hand, there is evidence
               suggesting that digital technologies have not created many new
               jobs to replace old ones: an upper bound estimate is that around
               0.5 percent of the US workforce is employed in digital industries
               that emerged throughout the 2000s. Nevertheless, at first
               approximation, there is no evidence to suggest that the computer
               revolution so far has reduced overall demand for jobs as
               technologically stagnant sectors of the economy – including
               health care, government and personal services – continue to
               create vast employment opportunities. Looking forward, however,
               we argue that as the potential scope of automation is expanding,
               many sectors that have been technologically stagnant in the past
               are likely to become technologically progressive in the future.
               While we should expect a future surge in productivity as a
               result, the question of whether gains from increases in
               productivity will be widely shared depends on policy responses.",

  abstract  = "This book predicts the decline of today's professions and
               introduces the people and systems that will replace them. In an
               internet-enhanced society, according to Richard Susskind and
               Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers,
               accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and
               many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future
               of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies
               - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the
               'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips
               of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face
               interaction. The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the
               arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's
               professionals. They argue that our current professions are
               antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the
               expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place,
               they propose five new models for producing and distributing
               expertise in society. The book raises profound policy issues, not
               least about employment (they envisage a new generation of
               'open-collared workers') and about control over online expertise
               (they warn of new 'gatekeepers') - in an era when machines become
               more capable than human beings at most tasks. With a new preface
               exploring recent critical developments, this updated edition
               builds on the authors' groundbreaking research into more than a
               dozen professions. Illustrated with numerous examples from each,
               this is the first book to assess and question the relevance of
               the professions in the 21st century.",

               of skills has changed in recent years with shifts in the balance
               of power between capital and labour and how the new social
               construction of skills affects different types of workers by sex,

               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy
               profession which aims, amongst other things, to assist in the
               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,

               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process

               in the accountancy profession framed within a discussion of those

               ‘intelligent tutors’ because they are able to continously adapt
               the content and style of their instruction to best meet the needs
               of the learner. The historical evolution of intelligent tutoring
               systems is presented. The starting point was programmed
               instruction in the late 1960s, followed by knowledge-based tutors
               that try to simulate good human tutors by the integrated use of
               domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and knowledge about the

               developing new knowledge, solving design and technical problems,
               overcoming different types of challenges present in the
               contemporary profession, and improving the design outcomes.
               Innovation requires a much stronger correlation between research

               this paper, we argue for an ecological or scaled approach that

               case-studies to allow for more comprehensive analysis of the
               external and internal factors that shape policy-making and
               education systems. Such an approach allows for deeper
               understanding of the relationship between globalizing trends and

               capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and
               the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the
               nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the ?epistemology
               of possession,? since it treats knowledge as something people
               possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing
               found in individual and group practice. Knowing as action calls
               for an ?epistemology of practice.? Moreover, the epistemology of
               possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and
               knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups.
               Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and
               by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right.
               Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit,
               individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and
               coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot),
               and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not
               competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that
               knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and
               physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing
               can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe
               this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful
               source of organizational innovation. Harnessing this innovation
               calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that
               support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these
               concepts make possible a more robust framing of such
               epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the
               management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these views
               through three brief case studies drawn from recent research.",

               thick description of business innovation typologies relating to
               the offsite construction industry in the US. Offsite construction
               is ‘the process of planning, designing, fabricating,

               assembly to a greater degree of finish than in traditional
               piecemeal on-site construction’. Legislatively, however, the
               process was more clearly regulated and streamlined, occurring
               primarily offsite, which helps explain why one in every ten
               housing units constructed each year today in the US are
               manufactured homes. The US economy presents new opportunities for
               permanent modular construction to compete. Disruptive, sustaining

  abstract  = "The three concepts central to this volume—practice, learning and
               change—have received very different treatments in the educational
               literature, an oversight directly confronted here. While learning
               and change have been extensively theorised, their various
               contexts articulated and analysed, practice is notably
               underrepresented. Where much of the literature on learning and
               change takes the notion of ‘practice’ as an unexamined given, its
               co-location as a term with various classifiers, as in ‘legal
               practice’ and ‘teaching practice’, render it curiously devoid of
               semantic force.In this book, ‘practice’ is the super-ordinate
               organising idea. Drawing on what has been termed the ‘practice
               turn in contemporary theory’, the work develops a conceptual
               framework for researching learning in, and on, practice. It
               challenges received notions of practice, questioning the
               assumptions, elisions, conflations and silences on the subject.
               In so doing, it offers fresh insights into learning and change,
               and how they relate to practice. In tandem with this conceptual
               work, the book details site-ontological studies of practice and
               learning in diverse professional and workplace contexts,
               examining the work of occupations as various as doctors, chefs
               and orchestral musicians. It demonstrates the value of theorising
               practice, learning and change, as well as exploring the

               Science",
  author    = "Hager, Paul and Beckett, David",
  publisher = "Springer Nature",
  abstract  = "This book centres on a broadened view of complexity that will
               enrich engagement with complexity in the social sciences. The key
               idea is to employ complexity theory to develop a holistic account
               of practice, agency and expertise. In doing so, the book
               acknowledges and builds upon the relational character of
               reductive accounts. It draws upon recent theoretical work on
               complexity, emergence and relationality to develop a novel
               account of practice, agency and expertise in and for workplaces.
               Biological, psychological and social aspects of these are
               integrated. This novel account overcomes problems in current
               views of practice, agency and expertise, which suffer from
               reductive, or fragmented, analyses, based upon individuals,
               groups, or networks. In retrieving the experiential richness of
               human activity – often esteemed as the basis of generative and
               creative life – this book shows how complexity both emerges from,
               and is, a non-reductive feature of, human experience, especially
               in daily work.“...an ambitiously wide-ranging volume, questioning
               the key tenets of respected approaches ..... and offering .....
               ‘novel accounts’, which draw on features of complexity
               thinking.... ...But they go further than any of us in their
               argument that: ‘whatever reductive moves are made, they ‘flow’
               from holistic accounts of relationality which have already
               affectively engaged the purposes of a co-present group.’ This is
               the intellectual contribution that is built consistently and
               persuasively across the chapters.” Professor Emerita Anne
               Edwards, Oxford University``Hager and Beckett have written a book
               that will challenge more commonly held notions of agency,
               practice, skills, and learning. Centering their argument on
               complexity theory or, as they prefer, complexity thinking, Hager
               and Beckett argue that it is through relations that we raise
               questions about, gather data from, and make working sense of the
               complexity that surrounds us. Groups then, particularly small
               groups, hold and implement agentive power. And what the authors
               call co-present groups—ones in which holistic relationality
               occurs socially, and affectively in distinctive places—“draw us
               closer to each other, and harness our normativity by enabling
               negotiability and reason-giving.” If your field of study involves
               anything remotely sociocultural in nature or if you are just
               interested in the complex ways we engage as humans with our
               worlds, you should find a place for this book in your

               to generate collaborations and communicate findings. The authors
               bring together the practical and the theoretical, enabling
               readers to build expertise on the principles and practice of case
               study research, as well as engaging with possible theoretical
               frameworks. They also highlight the place of case study as a key
               component of educational research. With the help of this book,
               M-Level students, teacher educators and practitioner researchers
               will gain the confidence and skills needed to design and conduct
               a high quality case study. Dr Lorna Hamilton is a Senior Lecturer
               in Education Research at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Connie
               Corbett-Whittier is an Associate Professor of English and
               Humanities at Friends University, Topeka, Kansas. ′Drawing on a
               wide range of their own and others′ experiences, the authors
               offer a comprehensive and convincing account of the value of case
               study in educational research. What comes across - quite
               passionately - is the way in which a case study approach can
               bring to life some of the complexities, challenges and
               contradictions inherent in educational settings. The book is
               written in a clear and lively manner and should be an invaluable
               resource for those teachers and students who are incorporating a
               case study dimension into their research work.′ -Ian Menter,

               is comprehensive in its coverage, yet detailed in its exposition
               of case study research. It is a highly interactive text with a
               critical edge and is a useful tool for teaching. It is of
               particular relevance to practitioner researchers, providing
               accessible guidance for reflective practice. It covers key
               matters such as: purposes, ethics, data analysis, technology,
               dissemination and communities for research. And it is a good
               read!′ - Professor Anne Campbell, formerly of Leeds Metropolitan

              However, it will be demonstrated in this article that this is a
              misinterpretation of Kolb's theory which results in a limited view
              of 'experience' within experiential learning. It is argued that
              not only a deeper understanding of Kolb's original theory is
              required, but a return must be made to John Dewey, perhaps the
              architect of experiential learning, to fully comprehend its
              importance. In so doing, a fuller appreciation of young people's

  abstract  = "The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been
               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.",

  abstract  = "Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an

               different training modalities on increasing workplace learning,
               representatives' intent to transfer what they learned into their
               work, and importantly how training impacts actual work
               performance. These relationships are tested in the context of a
               Chinese division of a multinational pharmaceutical company, where
               pharmaceutical representatives are tasked with relaying relevant
               efficacy and safety information on pharmaceutical products to
               health care professionals who prescribe them to patients.
               Methods: The present study employed a three-group
               between-subjects experimental design. Representatives received
               varying forms of training (instruction only, instruction plus
               reflection, and instruction, reflection, plus direct feedback)
               based on experimental conditions. After three training sessions
               over the course of six weeks, representatives were assessed on
               how much they learned in the training and their actual work
               performance through observer assessment of meetings with health
               care professionals, facilitated by the representatives. Findings:
               In this study, it was found that the process of actively
               reflecting on what was learned in training led to increased
               learning, as well as increased performance, compared to simply
               studying the material. However, receiving direct feedback on
               training performance, combined with active reflection training,
               did not provide any further benefits in terms of learning or work
               performance. Notably, there were no differences in intent to
               transfer learned material to work, as all conditions reported
               high levels of transfer intention. Conclusion: The finding
               provides insightful evidence to support the benefits of fostering
               trainees' active reflections for work-based learning in the
               Chinese industry training scenario. In contrast, receiving direct
               comments on how students performed from a manager or trainer, as
               well as advise on how do better in the future, had no effect on
               increasing learning or performance. Although the effect of direct
               feedback is not statistically significant in this context,
               further research should be done in understanding individuals'
               thoughts and behaviors when received direct feedbacks received in
               workplace training. Relatively little workplace research has
               assessed both workplace learning and performance in the same

                 is a course of learning across different school- and work-based
                 practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
                 boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
                 boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
                 discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
                 between school and work practices have frequently been reported
                 as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
                 individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
                 relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
                 chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential
                 of boundary crossing between school and work practices, which
                 we summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms:
                 identification, coordination, perspective making and taking (or
                 mutual reflection), and transformation. These learning
                 mechanisms are discussed through illustrations from vocational
                 education and training. The chapter concludes by speculating on
                 what would be fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a
                 vocational curriculum could be improved.",

               respectively. By doing so, the literature has adopted a rather
               passive perspective towards PhD candidates and their development.
               The active role of candidates being agentic constructors of their
               academic career has been widely neglected. This study therefore
               focuses on how PhD students can take an active approach towards
               their academic development. A qualitative interview study with
               ten German faculty members was conducted to answer the following
               research questions: (1) How do supervisors conceptualise academic
               success of PhD students? (2) How does professional agency affect
               academic success of young researchers? (3) What individual and/or
               contextual factors affect the exercise of professional agency?
               Based on these interviews, evidence is reported on how doctoral
               candidates can indeed affect their academic development and
               eventually their success by exercising professional agency. Among

               industry-spanning opportunities. However, exploiting these
               opportunities requires a targeted implementation of Industry 4.0.
               The purpose of this paper is to generate a deeper understanding
               of relevant implementation action. Existing recommendations are
               mostly general, highly aggregated and difficult to grasp. Yet,
               specific and concrete actions that need to be taken to accelerate
               the realization of Industry 4.0 are
               essential.Design/methodology/approach The article uses 13
               semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the source of
               empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers from
               Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies. All
               interviews are analyzed using qualitative content
               analysis.Findings The study reveals relevant and targeted aspects
               for Industry 4.0 implementation: the development of Industry
               4.0-specific know-how, securing financial resources, integrating
               employees into the implementation process and establishing an
               open-minded and flexible corporate culture. Further aspects
               include comprehensive planning processes, cooperation with
               external partners, proper handling of data interfaces,
               interdisciplinary communication, an adaptable organizational
               structure and data security.Research limitations/implications The
               paper is limited to German manufacturing enterprises and should

               Industry 4.0 within their organizations and consequently benefit
               from Industry 4.0 and derives recommendations for future
               research.Originality/value The paper is among the first to give
               specific and concrete examples for lessons learned from Industry

  abstract  = "The effective management of modern complex construction projects
               requires a clear understanding of how the stages and players
               involved interrelate. From the inception of the project onwards,
               information is generated which is then required to be adapted and
               communicated through the various stages to the individuals
               involved so as to complete the project. Of these stages, the
               design has always been recognised as important but, in project
               management terms, not easily managed. The activities involved in
               designing are complex and there is a need to employ the services
               of an increasing number of specialists. This research uses the
               framework developed in Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to
               establish the existing process involved in developing and
               managing the design. An important element of the building, the
               façade, is used as an example of what happens more generally and
               the research is based on an in-depth case study approach of four
               UK construction projects. To deal with the quantity and quality
               of the qualitative data, the methodology of cognitive mapping is
               used to first create, and then analyse, the perceptions of key
               decision makers involved in the creation and management of the
               design. Using computer based analytical tools the data is
               filtered through a number of stages to produce summaries of the
               process of design. The results of the research identify the need
               for the communication of the key project objectives, together
               with the formation of a strategy for achieving these objectives,
               at the outset. Selection of the right individuals, at the right
               time will significantly increase the development of the team
               approach, which is necessary to successfully develop the design.
               Finally, the use of formalised reviews can ensure that design
               progresses so as to meet the project objectives.",

               increasingly limits firm-level abilities to identify and pursue
               systemic innovation opportunities. Recent research identifies how
               integration strategies enable individual projects to break from
               this trap, but much less is known about potential strategic
               action of firms to enable systemic innovation. To explore this, a
               longitudinal comparative case study examines how three
               entrepreneurial firms ? DPR construction, RAD Urban, and Project
               Frog ? in the San Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic
               evolution and restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five
               years to enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each
               firm has developed a different approach ? relational,
               project-based spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems
               integration. Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The
               approaches are theorized as a form of strategic mirror-breaking
               intended to redefine the current paradigm of knowledge and task
               dependencies. They enable the firms to develop products with new
               system architectures and access more opportunities for innovation
               in digitally-enabled manufacturing. The paper concludes with
               discussion of how the identification and characterization of
               strategies for mirror-breaking enriches understanding of
               integration for systemic innovation in construction at the firm
               level. The paper identifies common themes for digitally-enabled
               manufacturing including the limitations of the current industry

                 sector has had a material effect on secular productivity growth
                 for the economy as a whole. Prior work has focused on the role
                 of potential measurement problems in construction, particularly
                 output deflators in the measurement of productivity. This paper
                 brings some new evidence to bear on the industry’s measured
                 productivity problems and suggests that measurement error is
                 probably not the sole source of the stagnation. First, using
                 measures of physical productivity in housing construction,
                 productivity is falling or, at best, stagnant over multiple
                 decades. Second, there has been a noticeable decline over time
                 in the efficiency with which construction firms translate
                 materials inputs into output, and a corresponding shift toward
                 more value-added-intensive production. Third, using state-level
                 data, we do not find evidence of patterns of within-industry
                 reallocation that might be expected of efficiently operating

               new interpretation of why technology has all too often benefited
               elites - and how we must reshape the path of innovation to create
               true shared prosperity.A thousand years of history and
               contemporary evidence make one thing clear. Progress is not
               automatic but depends on the choices we make about technology.
               New ways of organizing production and communication can either
               serve the narrow interests of an elite or become the foundation
               for widespread prosperity.Much of the wealth generated by
               agricultural advances during the European Middle Ages was
               captured by the Church and used to build grand cathedrals while
               the peasants starved. The first hundred years of
               industrialization in England delivered stagnant incomes for
               workers, while making a few people very rich. And throughout the
               world today, digital technologies and artificial intelligence
               increase inequality and undermine democracy through excessive
               automation, massive data collection, and intrusive
               surveillance.It doesn't have to be this way. Power and Progress
               demonstrates that the path of technology was once - and can again
               be - brought under control. The tremendous computing advances of
               the last half century can become empowering and democratizing
               tools, but not if all major decisions remain in the hands of a
               few hubristic tech leaders striving to build a society that
               elevates their own power and prestige.With their breakthrough
               economic theory and manifesto for a better society, Acemoglu and
               Johnson provide the understanding and the vision to reshape how
               we innovate and who really gains from technological advances so

               preferred ones. Practices of making futures are increasingly
               online. Yet, as organizational participants come together online
               ? organizing remotely to make offline futures ? they lack the
               shared experiential knowledge that is gained through embodied and
               situated practices. In this essay, we argue that the lack of
               experiential knowledge makes future making online difficult to
               organize and vulnerable to excluding relevant expertise; dialogue
               may become inward-looking and self-referential within the online
               environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the
               futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on
               the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to
               articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to
               suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as a
               form of inquiry ? as a distributed and reflective process that
               proceeds through engagement with representations of the future ?
               we identify three remedial actions for online future making: to
               solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change medium. These
               remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack of shared

               understand what shapes a firm?s choice to use external
               competences in its modularization strategy, we studied three
               leading construction firms. In this multiple case study, Alpha,
               Beta and Gamma are leaders in Asian markets, using reinforced
               concrete solutions in high-rise industrialized construction.
               Where external competences are available, our analyses show the
               work firms do to make them reliable and that their choice to use
               external competences is shaped by their reliability. Alpha
               modularized in a context with little available external
               competences, so it built new competences in-house; Beta chose to
               use the externally available manufacturing and assembly
               competences, using standards, remote monitoring and control of
               product architectures to make them reliable for their use in
               modularization; Gamma had available competences in the external
               context and initially sought to use them, but reliability
               concerns led to it modularizing by acquiring the firms to bring
               these competences in-house. Our contribution is to show how
               ensuring the reliability of external competences shapes
               modularization strategies. Further, we have identified actions
               that firms can adopt to make external competences reliable
               through: (1) use of international standards, (2) quality control
               procedures, (3) control of product architectures, and 4)
               acquisition of external competences. We provide implications for
               practitioners and policy makers seeking to transition to
               industrialized construction; and discuss new areas for research.",

               effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
               tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
               one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of tutoring.
               To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only on the
               effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the effectiveness
               of the students' construction on learning, as well as their
               interaction. The interaction hypothesis is further tested in the
               second study by manipulating the kind of tutoring tactics tutors
               were permitted to use. In order to promote a more interactive
               style of dialogue, rather than a didactic style, tutors were
               suppressed from giving explanations and feedback. Instead, tutors
               were encouraged to prompt the students. Surprisingly, students
               learned just as effectively even when tutors were suppressed from
               giving explanations and feedback. Their learning in the
               interactive style of tutoring is attributed to construction from
               deeper and a greater amount of scaffolding episodes, as well as
               their greater effort to take control of their own learning by
               reading more. What they learned from reading was limited,

               made A Short History of Nearly Everything one of the most lauded
               books of the last decade, and delivers one of the most
               entertaining and illuminating books ever written about the
               history of the way we live. Bill Bryson was struck one day by the
               thought that we devote a lot more time to studying the battles
               and wars of history than to considering what history really
               consists of: centuries of people quietly going about their daily
               business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more
               comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind
               can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we
               live.This inspired him to start a journey around his own house,
               an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room
               considering how the ordinary things in life came to be. Along the
               way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of
               anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from
               food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the
               Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant,
               creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered
               that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as
               our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest
               and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the

               enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge or
               skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally developed to
               support desktop training applications, with the most common
               domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g.,
               mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of
               game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent
               Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring
               architecture, provided tailored training experiences for military
               tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games including Virtual
               Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these game-based desktop
               tutors have also been limited to adaptive instruction for
               cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and decision-making). The
               military requires adaptive instruction to extend beyond the
               desktop to be compatible with the physical nature of many tasks
               performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen. This article examines
               how commercial sensor technologies might be adapted to work with

               the usability and system features of commercial smart glasses and
               pressure-sensing technologies. Smart glasses were selected as the
               focus of this study over handheld mobile devices in order to
               promote a hands-free experience during the training of
               hemorrhage-control tasks on a mannequin. Pressure sensors were
               selected to provide direct measures of effectiveness during the
               application of tourniquets and pressure bandages. Each set of
               technologies (smart glasses and pressure sensors) was evaluated
               not with respect to each other, but with respect to their
               capabilities to support adaptive instruction in the wild at the
               learner?s point-of-need and criteria based on established

               capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
               hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what
               system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are
               needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual

               accident rates. To prevent accidents, construction workers
               receive occupational safety training and safety instructions.
               However, experience-based learning of dangerous situations is
               hardly possible or justifiable in reality. Virtual reality (VR)
               simulations can be a potential solution in this regard by
               allowing workers to experience dangerous situations in a very
               vivid but safe way without being exposed to real hazards. In this
               study, a VR simulation for construction safety training was
               developed and tested with trainees that learn the safe operation
               of hand-operated power tools. In this particular case study, the
               objective for the participants in the VR simulation was to
               successfully consider all safety aspects in the operation of an
               angle grinder. The usability, user experience and implicit
               learning were investigated during the study. Additionally, we
               conducted post-play interviews with participants. Results found
               learning effects of participants as well as a satisfying user
               experience and usability. The results also show that participants
               might learn content as presented, risking the learning of false

              their way into classrooms and have proven to be more effective in
              delivering learning materials to students. Video games have been
              introduced as one of the possible new tools for educating the
              upcoming generation in many different fields. Specifically,
              construction management education has attempted to use simulation
              software to introduce students to various construction concepts.
              However, these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to
              the fun factor which has affected the uptake and therefore the
              educational impact of such tools. CONVEX is an educational video
              game that was developed with the objective of teaching high-level
              construction management concepts without sacrificing enjoyment. A
              study was conducted that showed that CONVEX impacted players’
              ability to recognize construction activity sequence as well as the
              resources required to complete these activities. C...",

              to enhance the construction management educational experience. One
              of these new methods is showing real time videos that highlight
              the various elements of concern in the classroom lecture. The
              purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality technology (ART)
              and a layer of artificial visualizations to simulate the
              environmental context and spatio-temporal constraints of various
              construction processes. The superimposition of images serves as an
              instructional mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite
              experiences into classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal
              constraints enables learners to visualize context and hidden
              processes otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom
              lectures. Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved
              perception of reality is created through the combination of the
              learners’ ability to understand the complexity of construction
              products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by
              viewing the real environment augmented with computer-generated
              information layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom
              with undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom
              learning and gives educators a teaching advantage when they
              combine traditional classroom lectures with ART enabled media.",

              the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds. The paper then

              students in classroom contexts. In classrooms where one teacher
              supports multiple students, scaffolding is distributed across

              distributed scaffolding is presented, to describe how students in
              classrooms may be supported by various tools and social scaffolds.
              The paper then introduces the kinds of distribution and
              interactions between tools and social scaffolds that need to be
              considered to support multiple students in classroom contexts.
              Finally, distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to

  abstract  = "Maimonides, in his Guide for the Perplexed,1 speaks of four forms
               of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest form is
               perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The great
               philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that the
               possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: “A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.” A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: “he could [in any case] not be as strong as a mule.”
               Moral perfection is the third, “the highest degree of excellency
               in man’s character.” Of this perfection Maimonides says: “Imagine
               a person being alone, and having no connection whatever with any
               other person; all his good moral principles are at rest, they are
               not required and give man no perfection whatever. These
               principles are only necessary and useful when man comes in
               contact with others.” “The fourth kind of perfection is the true
               perfection of man; the possession of the highest intellectual
               faculties . . . .” In justification of his assertion, this
               extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges: “Examine the
               first three kinds of perfection; you will find that if you
               possess them, they are not your property, but the property of
               others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is exclusively
               yours; no one else owns any part of it.”",

              trades apprenticeship programs in the USA, sponsored jointly by
              employers and unions, with those sponsored unilaterally by
              employers. It reviews enrolment and graduation rates, including
              participation of women and minorities. The article also looks
              behind the numbers to examine the operation of apprenticeship. It
              reviews the evolution of joint programs, including institutional
              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women and
              ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit markedly
              better performance for all groups on rates of attrition and
              completion. Joint programs have developed various innovations,
              including college credit for training and scholarship loans to
              expand apprenticeship and improve quality and retention, although
              there are no quantitative evaluations of the effectiveness of many
              of these specific measures. Research limitations/implications
              Statistical information includes about 65 percent of all
              registered apprentices in the USA. Practical implications The
              paper shows that alternative forms of training sponsorship have
              substantially different effects on enrolment and graduation.
              Identification of the practices, that improve enrolment and
              retention, and their widespread adoption would enhance the
              effectiveness of training programs. Originality/value The dataset
              used in this paper has not yet been used in any publications. The
              findings regarding joint programs are notable, in view of the

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design of
              an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two aspects
              of this work have subsequently been used for further research.
              Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its associated
              theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that it could be
              implemented in software. This interpretation has informed further
              research about how one can model context and its impact on
              learning, which has produced a design framework that has been
              successfully applied across a range of educational settings.
              Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The software has
              been adapted into a variety of versions that have supported
              explorations into how to scaffold learners’ metacognition, how to
              scaffold learners’ motivation and the implications of a learner’s
              goal orientation upon their use of the software. The findings from
              these studies have informed our understanding of learner
              scaffolding and have produced consistent results to demonstrate
              the importance of providing learners with appropriately
              challenging tasks and flexible support. Vygotsky’s work is as
              relevant now as it was in 1999: it still has an important role to

              theories of learning and teaching that take place with a large
              number of learners and a high ratio of learners to facilitators.

              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring systems.
              Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or substep-based
              granularities of interaction, whereas most other tutoring systems
              (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have answer-based user
              interfaces. It is widely believed as the granularity of tutoring
              decreases, the effectiveness increases. In particular, when
              compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring
              systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are
              believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review did
              not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the effect size

               and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose
               diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data
               sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once
               considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik
               Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of
               their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our
               lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies
               is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling
               personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless
               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this

               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing

               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and the
               opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and design.
               It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing

               environmental and political implications of various technological
               trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon future urban,
               spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within architecture.

  abstract  = "The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest challenges
               facing the construction industry. The Construction Users
               Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their workforce
               availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82 percent of
               the respondents reported experiencing work force shortages on
               their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the trend had
               worsened over the previous three years. One promising solution to
               relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to provide adequate
               and effective training. Many research efforts on construction
               worker training have been conducted in the past decade in order
               to address the need and benefits of construction craft training.
               However, a quantitative analysis of construction craft trainings
               benefits and costs from the perspective of worker, project and
               company has rarely been carried out. Providing quantifiable
               analysis regarding the benefits and costs of training can help to
               solve the debate existing in the industry regarding the value of
               craft labor training and improve the effectiveness of craft
               training programs. The research investigated existing major
               datasets relevant with construction craft training developed by
               previous research. Meanwhile, as part of this research, a craft
               director training survey was administrated to measure training
               benefits in productivity, turnover, absenteeism safety and
               rework, as well as information such as core training subjects and
               common barriers for training. The primary objective of the study
               is to qualify the outcomes and effectiveness of strategies for
               construction craft training. Four secondary objectives are
               completed to help achieve the primary goal: (I) Identify the
               major characteristics of construction training and major factors
               affecting construction training; (II) Quantitatively measure the
               outcomes of construction training on the individual and
               project/company level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio models
               based on the survey administrated by the study as well as
               existing industry data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity
               analysis to identify real multiskilling patterns among craft
               workers in order to adopt multiskilling training strategies in
               the construction industry.",

                 housing costs are considered. The wage gap between older and
                 younger workers has widened since the 2008 financial crisis and
                 shows no signs of closing. The outlook is uncertain, with young
                 people over-represented in jobs in sectors that are expected to
                 see lower employment growth in the long term, and vital
                 ‘stepping stone’ midskill jobs are in decline. So, as we emerge
                 from the pandemic, we must consider not simply what the impact

                 their skills and capabilities. If required, and with the right
                 support, they are willing to change career direction.

               by British unions since 1979. During that period, union
               membership has declined over 20 percent and three successive
               Conservative governments have enacted labor legislation opposed
               by unions. The author views the government's strongly unfavorable
               treatment of unions as a powerful force, but argues that economic
               and structural changes, such as the growth of temporary and
               part-time workers and the decline of the manufacturing sector,
               are likely to have more lasting adverse effects. Unions are
               adopting various strategies to try to counteract the decline of
               their membership, including innovative organizing methods and
               expanded services for members. The fate of the unions will
               depend, the author concludes, on the success of those strategies,
               changes in the British economy, and the Labour Party's fortunes
               in future general elections.",

               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
               extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET system
               serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation. Drawing
               upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and secondary
               data collected in three US cities, the paper argues that the
               focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks the
               emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open the
               prospects for skills and training innovations to meet changing

               the students' behavior. This chapter begins by providing an
               overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The chapter comments on
               competing research goals in the field, followed by descriptions
               of two successful systems: (1) the Pittsburgh urban math project

               underlying theory and implementation of each system, to motivate
               later discussions. A description of the standard components in an

              collaborative learning environments that adapt their
              characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
              feedback, to improve individual students’ collaborative
              interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically
              assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective
              collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is
              evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known
              about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does
              relevant support improve student interactions by providing
              just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are
              receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the
              collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
              interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
              have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in high
              school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA). To
              validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that
              demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant
              support and was more effective at improving student learning than
              parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve
              generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function
              adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support
              does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of

  abstract  = "Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the level
               and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In this
               study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters’ spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to develop
               further solutions that encourage further improvement of teaching
               and learning activities for spatial skills.",

               through which workplace learning more generally can be examined.
               Drawing on data from a 3-year study of the social and pedagogical
               relationships between apprentices and older workers in the
               English steel industry, the article proposes that, building on
               Engeström's work, an ‘expansive’ as opposed to a ‘restrictive’
               approach to apprenticeship will not only deliver the broader
               goals being set for apprenticeship programmes around the world,
               but will also foster workplace learning. The article offers a
               critique of Lave and Wenger's novice to expert conceptualisation
               of apprenticeship and, using data from employee learning logs,
               argues that pedagogical relationships between apprentices and
               older workers need to be better understood. A conceptual
               framework for analysing the relationship between organisational

               pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be adequate to
               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and
               training is meant to be stimulating and to equip us for life. The
               article concludes by arguing for a definition of vocational
               education and training which is a compound of the four general

              with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in height. Due to
              the excellent conservation of the oak timbers, studies of
              technological details and precise tree-ring dating were possible.
              The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55 BC, which makes
              this well the oldest dendrochronologically dated archaeological
              wooden construction worldwide. It is the third well from the Early
              Neolithic period that has been discovered in the Czech Republic
              within the last four years. The design consists of grooved corner
              posts with inserted planks. This type of construction reveals
              advanced technical know-how and, till now, is the only known type

              targets to combat climate change. At material level, mitigation
              opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less of the same

              article investigates the latter, with a global focus on the use of
              cross laminated timber to replace concrete floors in steel
              structural systems. This approach, whilst innovative, does not

              professional practice, thus making it an immediately viable
              solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We combine Material Flow
              Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across both spatial and
              temporal dimensions, accounting for different levels of uptake of
              the proposed hybrid construction in the next 30 years. Results
              show that greenhouse gas emissions saving potentials range between

              around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full uptake of the hybrid
              construction system by 2050. Our analysis does not account for
              carbon sequestration potential in timber, which would make the
              savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a 1.5\%
              reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions generally

  abstract    = "CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                 effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                 because their training has not fully prepared them to do so. To
                 address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                 systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                 'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                 learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                 information, to use resources effectively and innovatively, and
                 to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving in
                 practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have developed
                 study designs that use dynamic assessments to measure what
                 trainees have acquired in the past, as well as what they are
                 able to learn in the present. More recently, researchers have
                 also started to emphasise and measure whether and how trainees
                 take action to gain the information they need to learn. Knowing
                 that there are study designs and emerging metrics for assessing
                 PFL, the next question is how to design instruction that helps
                 trainees develop PFL capacities. Although research evidence is
                 still accumulating, the current evidence base suggests training
                 that encourages 'productive failure' through guided discovery
                 learning (i.e. where trainees solve problems and perform tasks
                 without direct instruction, though often with some form of
                 feedback) creates challenging conditions that enhance learning
                 and equip trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Preparation for future learning and the associated capacity of
                 being adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                 practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                 assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                 explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in the
                 health care workplace to inform the design of instruction for
                 developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours that
                 relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential sociocultural
                 barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to learn from
                 their daily practice.",

               design for anyone and everyone involved in creating VR
               experiences. Without a clear understanding of the human side of
               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and
               pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration
               and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR
               execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of
               understanding human perception, interaction, design principles,
               and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR,
               such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various
               forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and
               pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR
               applications. This book is not just for VR designers, it is for

               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method
               of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the
               most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge
               required for expert practice in fields from painting and
               sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation
               while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The
               differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods
               are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as
               a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills
               and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their
               uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand,
               target skills are not only continually in use by skilled
               practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of
               meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the
               learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional
               context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has
               serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that
               students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those
               implications through a proposal for the retooling of
               apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive
               skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new
               cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and
               problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as
               reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper
               is as follows: In the first section, we discuss briefly what we
               believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and
               pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural
               features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general,
               what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section
               we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical
               ``success models,'' which we believe exemplify aspects of
               apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning
               skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt
               to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to
               the development of not only the cognitive, but also the
               metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final
               section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and
               characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
               for the design of learning environments, where ``environment''
               includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods
               employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the
               sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive
               apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional
               apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in
               designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods,
               materials, and technologies.",

              series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized by
              functionally different knowledge structures underlying
              performance. The first phase is characterized by the accumulation
              of causal knowledge about disease and its consequences. Through
              experience with real cases, this knowledge transforms into
              narrative structures called illness scripts. The cognitive
              mechanisms responsible for this transition are: Encapsulation of
              elaborated knowledge into high level but simplified causal models
              or even diagnostic categories and tuning through the inclusion of
              contextual information. The third phase is characterized by the
              use of episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of
              new cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different
              phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process.
              These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any more
              in subsequent phases in the development of expertise, remain
              available for use when ontologically more recently acquired
              structures fail to produce an adequate representation of a

               the magnificent work it produces, helps demonstrates the
               worldwide impact of the industry. Chapter topics include The
               construction industry at large, the “players” in construction,
               the sequence of a project, and communications and documentation.
               Appendices cover: a narrative of a project sequence; the concept

               rewards. In recent years RL has achieved great success in
               inducing effective pedagogical policies for various interactive
               e-learning environments. However, it is often prohibitive to
               identify the critical pedagogical decisions that actually
               contribute to desirable learning outcomes. In this work, by
               utilizing the RL framework we defined critical decisions to be
               those states in which the agent has to take the optimal actions,
               and subsequently, the Critical policy as carrying out optimal
               actions in the critical states while acting randomly in others.
               We proposed a general Critical-RL framework for identifying
               critical decisions and inducing a Critical policy. The
               effectiveness of our Critical-RL framework is empirically
               evaluated from two perspectives: whether optimal actions must be
               carried out in critical states (the necessary hypothesis) and
               whether only carrying out optimal actions in critical states is
               as effective as a fully-executed RL policy (the sufficient
               hypothesis). Our results confirmed both hypotheses.",

  abstract  = "This paper is to investigate how employees’ tacit knowledge
               sharing behavior is influenced by various antecedents. We propose
               that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three specific behaviors
               (i.e., socialization, externalization, and internalization) and
               they are influenced by four antecedents (trust, self-efficacy,
               knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A survey was conducted to
               collect data from 258 knowledge workers who worked on complex
               product development projects. Structural equation modeling was
               used to analyze the data. The results demonstrate that trust,
               self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support significantly
               affect the externalization and internalization behaviors, and
               trust and IT support significantly affect the socialization
               behavior. This study is helpful to organizations where it is
               critical for employees to share tacit knowledge. It suggests that
               tacit knowledge is difficult to share and organizations should
               nurture mutual trust between employees, enhance their
               self-efficacy, and provide sufficient IT support so that they are
               more likely to engage in tacit knowledge sharing.",

  abstract = "Reprint: R1404G The value of many products and services rises or
              falls with the number of customers using them; the fewer fax
              machines in use, the less important it is to have one. These
              network effects influence consumer decisions and affect companies’
              ability to compete. Strategists have developed some well-known
              rules for navigating business environments with network effects.
              “Move first” is one, and “get big fast” is another. In a study of
              dozens of companies, however, the authors found that quite often
              the conventional wisdom was dead wrong. And when the rules failed,
              the reason was always the same: Companies trip up when they try to
              attract large volumes of customers without understanding (1) the
              strength of mutual attraction among various customer groups and
              (2) the extent of asymmetric attraction among them. Looking at
              examples such as TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, and the New York Times,
              the authors offer strategies for competing in markets with network
              effects. New entrants should focus on customer groups that they
              are uniquely positioned to serve or appeal to the most attractive
              customers in a market. Incumbents pursuing growth strategies in
              adjacent markets or new geographies should consider how similar
              the needs of new customers are to those of existing customers.
              Offering complements also allows incumbents to reach additional
              customer groups.",

               knowledge in the management literature is a dichotomy between
               tacit and explicit. Even the knowledge management literature
               tends to view knowledge on a limited number of dimensions,
               whether this is in discussions of knowledge as a commodity or the
               process of knowing. A review of knowledge from first principles
               shows that knowledge has different degrees of validity, is highly
               heterogeneous and has complicated temporal and social aspects. A
               model of knowledge based on these aspects is presented. Comparing
               the four dimensions of knowledge with knowledge as a process
               opens up a more holistic view of knowledge management and helps
               articulate some of the key differences within streams of research
               in the field. This holistic perspective is also compatible with
               Polanyi's original complex conception of tacit knowledge, which
               drew heavily on Gestalt theory, a theory that examines the
               perception of ``wholes''. The dual perspectives of a
               multi-dimensional conception of knowledge as a commodity and a
               holistic perspective on knowledge management expands the avenues
               of potential research and improves our ability to put knowledge

               than we can tell.'' Many researchers in the knowledge management
               community have used the idea of tacit knowledge to draw a
               distinction between that which cannot be formally represented
               (tacit knowledge) and knowledge which can be so represented
               (explicit knowledge). I argue that the deference that knowledge
               management researchers give to tacit knowledge hinders
               potentially fruitful work for two important reasons. First, the
               inability to explicate knowledge does not imply that the
               knowledge cannot be formally represented. Second, assuming the
               inability to formalize tacit knowledge as it exists in the minds
               of people does not exclude the possibility that computer systems
               might perform the same tasks using alternative representations.
               By reviewing work from artificial intelligence, I will argue that
               a richer model of cognition and knowledge representation is
               needed to study and build knowledge management systems.",

  abstract  = "What artificial intelligence can tell us about the mind and
               intelligent behavior.What can artificial intelligence teach us
               about the mind? If AI's underlying concept is that thinking is a
               computational process, then how can computation illuminate
               thinking? It's a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the
               buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer
               systems that learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of
               data. This is what powers a driverless car, for example. In this
               book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to “good old
               fashioned artificial intelligence,” which is based not on heaps
               of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind
               of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that
               depart from previous patterns—as we do in real life, when, for
               example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista
               informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
               of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that
               passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he
               proposes another way to test for intelligence—the Winograd Schema
               Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. “If our goal is
               to understand intelligent behavior, we had better understand the
               difference between making it and faking it,” he observes. He
               identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the
               capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to
               represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more
               and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without
               common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.",

                 direction in the development of training tools in medical
                 education. We carried out a panel discussion at the Center for
                 Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference, prompted by the study,
                 ``The Responses of Medical General Practitioners to

                 et al.'s study, 21 general practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees
                 took part in a videoed, 15-min virtual reality scenario
                 involving unnecessary patient demands for antibiotics. This
                 paper was discussed in-depth at the Center for Behavior Change
                 3rd Annual Conference; the content of this paper is a
                 culmination of findings and feedback from the panel discussion.
                 The experts involved have backgrounds in virtual reality,

                 an unexplored methodology to instigate positive behavioral
                 change among clinicians where other methods have been
                 unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial stewardship. There are
                 several arguments in favor of use of virtual reality in medical
                 education: it can be used for ``difficult to simulate''
                 scenarios and to standardize a scenario, for example, for use
                 in exams. However, there are limitations to its usefulness
                 because of the cost implications and the lack of evidence that
                 it results in demonstrable behavior change.",

               those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not
               specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their
               path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on
               one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make
               connections their more specialized peers can't spy from deep in
               their hyperfocused trenches. As experts silo themselves further
               while computers master more of the skills once reserved for
               highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace
               diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.
               Our obsession with getting a head start is understandable; early
               specialization feels efficient. But Epstein marshals an enormous
               body of scientific research to argue that we should all actively
               cultivate inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn.

               and motor skills. The future of work will increasingly feature
               human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks
               and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning
               in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants,
               where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they
               are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we
               explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that
               help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by
               providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized
               experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse
               than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and
               learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but
               was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at
               all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even
               when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel
               learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy,
               with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be
               used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates

                 metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and
                 emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an
                 extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of
                 variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy,
                 volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a
                 comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has
                 become one of the most important areas of research within
                 educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                 analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and
                 Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller.
                 First, each model is explored in detail in the following
                 aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the
                 model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and
                 (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the
                 models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b)
                 phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize
                 (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d)
                 top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the
                 discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                 meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                 extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed.
                 The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models
                 form an integrative and coherent framework from which to
                 conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more
                 strategic and successful. Second, based on the available
                 meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL
                 models in light of differences in students' developmental
                 stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need
                 to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models
                 and theories to enhance students' learning and SRL skills.",

                 experiences for engineering students. However, such
                 practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to
                 allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring the
                 job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed to
                 investigate how job demands, job control, and social support
                 affect interns' use of different learning strategies. Method
                 The study utilized data collected from a sample of engineering
                 students (n =?118) who completed a required internship during
                 their degree. The data were analyzed using a structural
                 equation modeling approach including latent factors. Results
                 Job demands were found to be a relevant and significant driver
                 of students' shared regulation (e.g., asking for feedback),
                 self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use of codified
                 information), efforts to relate theory to practice (e.g.,
                 connecting workplace experience with theoretical knowledge),
                 and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g., lack of
                 adaptation to work situations), but not of external regulation
                 (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job control,
                 however, was not found to be a positive or significant driver
                 of student learning. Social support was found to be a relevant
                 and significant predictor of external and shared regulation but
                 not of the other learning activities. Conclusions This study
                 provided mixed findings regarding key hypotheses central to the
                 JDCS model, generating rather poor evidence supporting it. In
                 fact, job demands, job control, and social support exhibited
                 much less explanatory power than expected for engineering
                 students' learning during internships.",

               Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics, this is the ultimate guide to

               stand for something: challenging conventional wisdom; using data
               rather than emotion to answer questions; and learning to unravel
               the world's secret codes. Now Levitt and Dubner have gathered up
               what they have learned and turned it into a readable and
               practical toolkit for thinking differently - thinking, that is,
               like a Freak. Whether you are interested in the best way to
               improve your odds in penalty kicks, or in major global reforms,
               here is a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems.
               Along the way, you'll learn how the techniques of a Japanese
               hot-dog-eating champion can help you, the reason an Australian
               doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, why Nigerian
               e-mail scammers make a point of saying they're from Nigeria, and
               why Van Halen's demanding tour contract banning brown M\&Ms was
               really a safety measure. You'll learn why sometimes it's best to
               put away your moral compass, and smarter to think like a child.
               You will be given a master class in incentives-because for better
               or worse, incentives rule our world. And you will learn to quit

               theory–integrated construction training for current industry
               professionals. To measure the extent of educational theory

               of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of student learning
               outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly used words within
               the identified construction training literature and foundational

               have incorporated educational theory in the design and
               implementation of the training. The results reveal that, of the
               15 construction training studies that met the inclusion criteria,
               two-thirds (2/3) focused on worker safety and only three studies

               that were identified as frequently used terms in the published
               construction training studies were categorized as educational.
               The results of this study provide a baseline of education
               theory–integrated construction training research, from which gaps

               of creativity. Learn how: a slow hunch can be much more valuable
               than a Eureka moment; the connected 'hive mind' is smarter than
               the lone thinker; where you think matters just as much as what
               you're thinking; and, the best ideas come from building on the
               ideas and inventions of others. From the Renaissance to
               satellites, medical breakthroughs to social media, Charles Darwin
               to Marconi, Steven Johnson shows how, by recognising where and
               how patterns of creativity occur, we can all discover the secrets

               but during the last 25 years there have been achievements in a
               number of fields which have made impact on education. Critical
               voices have been raised against the over-optimism in contemporary
               AI research. Less have been written about the high expectation of
               AIED and its potential impact on education. The aim of this study
               was to analyse and discuss AIED from the teacher perspective.
               This study was carried out as a SWOT-analysis, with data gathered
               from a literature study. Main keywords in the literature search
               were: artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence in
               education, AIED, teacher perspective, education and teacher.
               Themes and patterns in the four main categories where further
               processed as a deductive-inductive thematic analysis. Findings
               indicates that there are both promises and threats for the
               teacher in the contemporary AIED. In several aspects the field
               seems to be in a state of hype but as other hype areas there is a
               potential for maturing and with concrete applications in daily
               teaching and learning activities. Recommendations is to learn
               from traditional AI and to open up for an informative and nuanced
               discussion concerning the role of AI in education. Otherwise

               characterised by several regional differences, including the

               produced through good silvicultural practices and is properly

               brilliant conception of individual competence, known as Multiple
               Intelligences theory, has changed the face of education. Tens of
               thousands of educators, parents, and researchers have explored
               the practical implications and applications of this powerful
               notion, that there is not one type of intelligence but several,
               ranging from musical intelligence to the intelligence involved in
               self-understanding.Multiple Intelligences distills nearly three
               decades of research on Multiple Intelligences theory and
               practice, covering its central arguments and numerous
               developments since its introduction in 1983. Gardner includes
               discussions of global applications, Multiple Intelligences in the
               workplace, an assessment of Multiple Intelligences practice in
               the current conservative educational climate, new evidence about

               in the subject of learning by modeling and offers an extensive
               review of the major theories, edited by one of the most
               influential psychologists of his generation. In his introductory
               essay, Bandura identifies the most important controversial issues
               in the field of observational learning and reviews a large body
               of research findings, before carefully chosen articles, written
               by a team of expert contributors, tackle a range of key debates
               in the field. Topics explored include the role of reinforcement
               play in observational learning, the scope of modeling influences,
               the types of people most susceptible to modeling influences, and
               the relative effectiveness of models presented in live action, in
               pictorial presentations, or through verbal description. Written
               in a lively and engaging manner, this book will be of interest to
               all psychology students interested in psychological modeling, as

               play a complementary role when learners exploit differences in
               their form and content by switching between and selecting the
               appropriate representation for the task at hand. Constraining
               benefits are achieved when learners can profit from the support
               of a familiar representation to understand a new and complex
               representation. Finally, if learners abstract across multiple
               representations, they can construct a deeper understanding of the
               nature of the representations and the domain they represent. This

              current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
              criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the creation
              of a framework for construction training. There is a lack of
              recommendations for improvement of construction training across
              the industry. To establish the current state of construction
              industry training, a review of education theory-integrated
              training for construction professionals is undertaken. To measure
              the extent of educational theory integration, this dissertation
              summarizes studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the
              frequency of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of
              student learning outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly
              used words within the identified construction training literature
              and foundational educational theory literature. The results
              provide a baseline of education theory-integrated construction
              training research, from which gaps and best practices can be
              identified. Existing construction training programs are not
              properly measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
              methodologies used in construction trainings published in archival
              literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of training
              programs. These practices are compared against the Kirkpatrick
              Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment methodologies in
              the literature are synthesized with corresponding levels found in
              the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly integrating educational theory
              into construction workforce training has the potential to improve
              industry training; however, there is a dearth of studies that
              present details of this integration process. To address this gap,
              a training framework is created to educate material installers on
              material properties, selection, and installation. This framework
              is based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
              principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
              similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
              training implementation. The created framework culminates by
              establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed training
              modules.",

               presents a framework for construction industry training
               assessment that identifies established practices rooted in
               evaluation science and developed from a review of archival
               construction industry training literature. Inclusion criteria for
               the evaluated studies are: archival training studies focused on
               the construction industry workforce and integration of
               educational theory in training creation or implementation.
               Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case
               review is presented detailing assessment practices and results.
               The assessment practices are then synthesized with the
               Kirkpatrick Model to analyze how closely industry assessment
               corresponds with established training evaluation standards. The
               study culminates in a training assessment framework created by
               integrating practices described in the identified studies,
               established survey writing practices, and the Kirkpatrick Model.

  abstract = "Skilled labor is vital to the success of any construction project,
              and no contractor would be able to operate without the skilled
              laborers that they employ. The construction industry has been
              subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last two decades
              for many reasons, including the poor image of construction workers
              among the public, inadequate training measures, and an aging
              workforce. Reviewing the literature on the matter shows that the
              leading cause of shortage is low pay and increasing age of the
              workforce overall, while the demand for labor grows at a faster
              rate than the supply of labor grows. Poor worker retention
              practices were also identified as a cause for shortage and a
              reason for workers leaving the industry, and proper retention
              tactics are assessed, including monetary and non-monetary
              considerations for workers in order to foster a better
              employer-employee relationship. Recruiting practices among labor
              unions and contractors are also assessed through interviews and

  abstract  = "The ‘traditional’ construction industry has constantly been
               challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices. Offsite
               production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods of
               construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help
               improve construction industry performance as well as meet new
               market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and
               sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems, if
               not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and be
               counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
               construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the
               specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP
               systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and consequently
               improve industry performance.On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually
               sought to facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to
               be particularly effective where a great deal of independence is
               granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been criticised
               for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of the actual
               training context. In order to address the problems encountered
               with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been
               proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype,
               in order to provide a risk-free environment for learning without
               the ‘do-or-die’ consequences often faced on real construction
               projects. The proffered solution provides a unique VR environment
               for practicing new working conditions associated with OSP
               practices. While the ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on
               a construction site, the environment predominantly targets
               professionals, such as project managers, construction managers,
               architects, designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow
               multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome
               ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR
               environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by
               professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety
               issues to occur; where the implications of which can be evaluated
               in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR environment
               proposed does not aim to resolve problems associated with OSP per
               se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go wrong’ and consequently
               allows users not only to ‘experience’ the resulting implications
               but also to reflect on those implications as part of the learning
               process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for the
               first development phase of the VR interactive training
               environment. While the prototype was tested and validated with
               domain experts from industry, the research community, and
               academia from different EU countries, the data used in developing
               the prototype was constrained to one project in the UK which may
               limit the generalisability of results.",

               evidence-based e-learning design. Since the first edition of this
               book, e-learning has grown to account for at least 40\% of all
               training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail to
               reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency.
               This guide provides research-based guidelines on how best to
               present content with text, graphics, and audio as well as the
               conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This
               updated fourth edition describes the guidelines, psychology, and
               applications for ways to improve learning through personalization
               techniques, coherence, animations, and a new chapter on
               evidence-based game design. The chapter on the Cognitive Theory
               of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms of cognitive load
               which are revisited throughout each chapter as the psychological
               basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on engagement in
               learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews of how to
               leverage worked examples, practice, online collaboration, and
               learner control to optimize learning. The updated instructor's
               materials include a syllabus, assignments, storyboard projects,
               and test items that you can adapt to your own course schedule and
               students. Co-authored by the most productive instructional
               research scientist in the world, Dr. Richard E. Mayer, this book
               distills copious e-learning research into a practical manual for
               improving learning through optimal design and delivery. Get up to
               date on the latest e-learning research Adopt best practices for
               communicating information effectively Use evidence-based
               techniques to engage your learners Replace popular instructional
               ideas, such as learning styles with evidence-based guidelines
               Apply evidence-based design techniques to optimize learning games
               e-Learning continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the
               classroom, and correspondingly, has become a focus among
               researchers in learning-related fields. New findings from
               research laboratories can inform the design and development of
               e-learning. However, much of this research published in technical
               journals is inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning
               material. By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume
               and translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning
               and the Science of Instruction has become an essential resource

               shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
               construction sector in the European Union Member States,
               foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of people
               is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which also
               includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages in the EU
               are expected to increase in the future due to a declining
               population and an ageing workforce. In order to recognize and
               forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use a variety of
               instruments but they do not answer as to whether it is possible
               to use migrant labour to appease those shortages. There are
               several systems used to classify labour shortages in the EU
               Member states. Most of the countries classify labour shortages in
               relation to different sectors or occupation groups as well as by
               skill levels, but in some Member States, classification is made
               according to the type of employment. Instruments used to measure
               labour shortages significantly differ from country to country.
               Several criteria are used for creating lists of shortage
               occupations and most of the criteria include demand side and
               supply side criteria. A majority of the Member States are facing
               labour and skill shortages in various sectors and the
               construction sector is not an exception. As total employment in
               the construction sector decreased, so did the share of employed
               migrants. Labour shortages in the construction sector can be
               eased by the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
               unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
               low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
               the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be working,
               which has an impact on the development and implementation dynamic

               Denis, 2018) to promote knowledge-based skills in various sectors

               4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
               to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
               digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
               authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
               fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
               constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
               developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
               the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal fragmentation
               and to take a holistic approach to the improvements needed in the
               industry. In this study, a literature review of Industry 4.0 and
               its influence on the construction sector was undertaken. Based on
               this systematic literature review, the authors define the
               Construction 4.0 framework and provide its benefits and barriers
               to implementation. A key finding of the study is that building
               information modeling, and a common data environment form the key
               foundation for the implementation of the Construction 4.0
               framework. In defining the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper
               described its components and how its implementation is likely to
               proceed. The authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0,
               the industry can transform itself into a highly efficient,
               quality-centered, and safe industry capable of successfully
               delivering the demands placed on it by society.",

              state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0
              relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out
              the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and
              legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present
              the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a
              comprehensive systematic literature review and case study

               market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity performance
               is regarded as weak, with low skills levels considered to be a
               key contributory factor. Consequently, off-site construction has
               been identified by the UK Government as a vehicle for improving
               productivity levels if the skills deficiencies in this particular
               market segment can be addressed. A series of projects were,
               therefore, launched by the UK Commission for Employment and
               Skills (UKCES) to encourage an R\&D approach to skills and
               development application in the workplace. This paper reports on
               one of these research projects, a University and Industry
               collaboration between two of the largest off-site timber platform
               frame manufacturers in the UK. The paper explains how a needs
               analysis process was utilised to develop skills training content
               tailored to the immediate needs of the industry partners. It also
               explores how working with academia and a wider community of
               stakeholders allowed this training content to result in
               sector-level impact via knowledge exchange activities and generic
               skills material creation. Finally, the novel approach of

               paper is evidence of success in mobilising industry through
               creating communities of practice to advance the construction
               sector regionally. It also provides a generalisable method that

               accident rate and many practitioners consider a preventative
               approach to be the most important means of bringing about
               improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
               research and the weaknesses of existing preventative approaches
               and then to describe and illustrate a new application involving
               the use of a multi‐dimensional simulation tool – Construction
               Virtual Prototyping (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA literature
               review was conducted to investigate previous studies of hazard
               identification and safety management and to develop the new
               approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the research
               study explored the use of computer simulation techniques to
               create virtual environments where users can explore and identify
               construction hazards. Specifically, virtual prototyping
               technology was deployed to develop typical construction scenarios
               in which unsafe or hazardous incidents occur. In a case study,
               the users' performance was evaluated based on their responses to
               incidents within the virtual environment and the effectiveness of
               the computer simulation system established though interviews with
               the safety project management team.FindingsThe opinions and
               suggestions provided by the interviewees led to the initial
               conclusion that the simulation tool was useful in assisting the

               early design stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an
               innovative method to support the management team's reviews of
               construction site safety. The system utilises three‐dimensional
               modelling and four‐dimensional simulation of worker behaviour, a
               configuration that has previously not been employed in
               construction simulations. An illustration of the method's use is

              lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
              about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
              programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
              entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal value.
              Today they do not always meet current building standards and many
              are in need of refurbishment. The Million Homes programme
              incorporated a large variety of technical building solutions,
              andknowledge about former building practices is needed if
              refurbishment is to be successful. Industrialised builders in
              Sweden have recognized the use of a platform as one means of
              sharing knowledge. A platform is essentially the collection of
              assets that are shared by a set of products. In a platform for
              housing refurbishment the assets have knowledge and process
              content (as opposed to product content) and will probably also
              contain many relationships. The interview study carried out as
              part of the research shows that the main purpose of a platform
              concept is to standardize components and processes. To increase
              the possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
              buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should be on
              the individuals who will actually be sharing their knowledge and
              especially on social motivations. It is important that managers
              and leaders demonstrate knowledge sharing behaviors as this will
              lead to the establishment of a culture where knowledge sharing is
              the norm; in the context of this study this is especially
              important for the creation of an efficient platform concept for

               consequences for platform organization by studying its use in
               house-building. The multiple case study on four
               engineering/contractor firms reports the core capabilities for
               engineer-to-order firms: procurement and tendering, market
               knowledge, engineering, multi-skilled manufacturing, and
               coordination of sales and manufacturing. Design-to-order,

  author    = "Hammersley, Martyn",
  publisher = "SAGE",
  abstract  = "The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing, role;
               while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts, or
               indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that, in
               large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands it
               places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as the
               proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the false
               idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or social
               critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics of
               belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he also
               questions the role of the social research within society and what
               it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It
               tackles the major issues of contemporary social research
               methodology head on and is an essential read for anyone with an
               interest in this field.",

               industrial building and planning from the end of the nineteenth
               century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. Drawing on
               research from the United States, Europe and Australia, this
               collection of essays highlights key moments in industrial
               architecture and planning representative of the wider paradigms

               factories, hydroelectricity, aerospace, logistics, finance,
               scientific research and mining. The selected case studies serve
               to highlight architectural and planning innovations in industry
               and their contributions to wider cultural and societal currents.
               This richly illustrated collection will be of interest for a wide

               fundamentally a social process. The authors maintain that
               learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining
               characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral
               participation (LPP). Learners participate in communities of
               practitioners, moving toward full participation in the
               sociocultural practices of a community. LPP provides a way to
               speak about crucial relations between newcomers and old-timers
               and about their activities, identities, artefacts, knowledge and
               practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives,

  abstract  = "The concept of human capital is very common in present-day
               construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
               techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in different
               fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to another.
               This study provides a detailed discussion on the development of
               the human capital theory under various themes and sub-themes. The
               study further seeks to discuss the several effects of human
               capital development on industry success and competitiveness and
               how this contributes to economic growth in developing countries.
               Relevant literatures on HC theory and development were extracted
               from Scopus. Scopus is widely acknowledged as one of the widest
               interdisciplinary databases for engineering, technology, science
               and medicine. The Scopus database features over 20, 000+
               peer-reviewed journals from over 5000 publishers. The Scopus
               database allows its users to perform more detailed searching
               opportunities compared to other databases such as Academic Search
               Complete, Art and Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host, SpringerLink
               and Web of science. The distillation of literature through
               thematic analysis revealed the various roles of human capital and
               its correlation with construction industry success and growth.
               Findings from this study revealed that the success of the
               construction industry is firmly related to the effectiveness of
               its human capital. The study revealed that the human capital
               theory is not without its criticisms and barriers. Practically,
               this study explores the various benefits of human capital to
               employers of the construction industry. The study suggests that
               human capital development plays a key part in retaining quality
               employees and recruiting prospects. Furthermore, investment in
               human capital goes a long way in improving employee satisfaction,
               organisational culture and increased productivity. This study
               contributes to the human capital discourse, which is the measure
               of economic value provided by employees with reference to their
               abilities, skills, values and knowledge.",

               interpretation of American business history during the formative
               years 1870-1920, which mark the dawn of modern big business. It
               focuses on four major revolutions that ushered in this new era:
               those in power, transportation, communication, and organization.
               Using the metaphor of America as an economic hothouse uniquely
               suited to rapid economic growth during these years, it analyzes
               the interplay of key factors such as entrepreneurial talent,
               technology, land, natural resources, law, mass markets, and the
               rise of cities. It also delineates the process that laid the
               foundation for the modern era, in which virtually every human
               activity became a business, and, in most cases, a big business.
               The book also profiles numerous major entrepreneurs whose careers
               and activities illustrate broader trends and themes. It utilizes
               a wide variety of sources, including novels from the period, to

               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional
               material including research articles, readings, case studies,
               activities, bibliography tools and inspiration to pursue your
               curiosity, impress your lecturer, and nail your assignments. With
               this one book, every student gets what they need to succeed. It
               is the perfect essential text for students and beginner

               patterns, the UK construction industry recently has made
               considerable efforts to attract more women to its professions.
               However, despite their increasing representation, there are
               indications that women experience difficulties in developing
               their careers within the industry. This research investigated the
               careers of men and women working for large construction
               companies, in order to establish the gender determined influences
               on women's career progression. A primarily qualitative
               methodology was employed for the research, in which career
               profiles were developed through ethnographic interviews with 41
               matched pairs of male and female employees. This allowed the
               gender specific determinants of careers to be established across
               a range of different organizations, and from informants at
               different vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis resulted
               in the formulation of a set of eight interrelated theoretical
               models, from which a theory of women's career development was
               constructed. The theory reflects the belief that the construction
               workplace is a competitive and conflictual environment, where
               women are overtly and covertly discriminated against by men, who
               use structural systems to undermine their participation. The
               women interviewed were found to have dealt with these barriers in
               a way which perpetuated existing work cultures. If reflected
               throughout the industry, this would suggest the existence of a
               self-fulfilling cycle of women's continued under-achievement. The
               paper puts forward the radical proposition that women should not
               be attracted to the industry unless steps are taken to moderate
               its exclusionary and discriminatory culture.",

               state where contemplated questions are of more value than hasty

               theory formulation than theory testing. More specifically, it
               derives a grounded theory of construction crisis management which
               forms a useful basis for future research. It does so from an
               investigation of the complex patterns of communication and
               behaviour which emerge in response to construction crises. The
               conclusion is that construction crisis management is about the
               effective control of social and behavioural instability and the
               conflict which arises out of it. However, effective crisis
               management is made difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms
               which construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory
               also is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
               thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
               context is identified.",

  abstract  = "Professional Development of Teacher Educators in Further
               Education critically analyses the specific challenges relating to
               teacher educators in the English further education (FE), such as
               the diverse nature of learners and the variety of educational
               contexts. It focuses on the journeys to becoming teacher
               educators, their relevant teaching know-how and professional
               needs. This book combines theoretical frameworks with both
               qualitative and quantitative data to outline the pathways,
               professional identities, knowledge, and continuous professional
               development of teacher educators. This data is used to discuss
               the four main themes. The first deals with the teacher educators’
               initial disciplinary areas, journey-making to be educators, and
               the current titles/positions. The next one delineates the
               know-how (knowledge, experiences, capacities and skill sets) to
               perform as teacher educators. The third one relates to their
               professional identities and the final topic, their professional
               requirements as FE teacher educators. Contributing to the field
               of further and vocational education, this book will be of great
               interest for researchers, academics, and postgraduate students in
               the field of education, specifically FE and teacher educators.",

  author    = "Loo, Sai and Sutton, Brian",
  publisher = "Routledge",
  abstract  = "Informal Learning, Practitioner Inquiry and Occupational
               Education explores how practitioners in a variety of occupations
               perform their jobs and argues that working and learning are
               intricately connected. Drawing on theories around working and
               learning in informal, formal and lifelong settings, the book
               gives insights into how workers negotiate their occupational
               practices. The book investigates four related concepts – informal
               learning, practitioner inquiry, occupational education and
               epistemological perspectives. The combinations of theories and
               empirical case studies are used to provide a conceptual framework
               of inquiry where knowledge, abilities, experiences and skill sets
               play a significant aspect. It presents 11 case studies of
               professions ranging from conventional occupations of acting,
               detective work, international road transportation to emerging
               professions of boardroom consultancy, nutritional therapy and
               opinion leadership. This book will be of great interest for
               academics, scholars and postgraduate students who are engaged in
               the study of informal education, vocational education and
               occupation-related programmes. It will also offer significant
               insights for related education practitioners wanting to have
               greater understanding of their own journeys and practices.",

  abstract  = "How the obsession with quantifying human performance threatens
               business, medicine, education, government—and the quality of our
               livesToday, organizations of all kinds are ruled by the belief
               that the path to success is quantifying human performance,
               publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the
               numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with
               scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to
               fixating on measuring itself—and this tyranny of metrics now
               threatens the quality of our organizations and lives. In this
               brief, accessible, and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the
               damage metrics are causing and shows how we can begin to fix the
               problem. Filled with examples from business, medicine, education,
               government, and other fields, the book explains why paying for
               measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may
               increase deaths, and much more. But Muller also shows that, when
               used as a complement to judgment based on personal experience,
               metrics can be beneficial, and he includes an invaluable
               checklist of when and how to use them. The result is an essential
               corrective to a harmful trend that increasingly affects us all.",

  abstract  = "A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be
               applied to our everyday lives. In this dazzlingly
               interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and
               cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show us how the simple, precise
               algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human
               questions. Modern life is constrained by limited space and time,
               limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What
               should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much
               messiness should we accept? The authors explain how to have
               better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal
               with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others.
               From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing
               one's inbox to understanding the workings of human memory,
               Algorithms To Live By is full of practical takeaways to help you
               solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings

               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The

               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be

               combines the promise of industrialised building with the dream of
               a popular mass market for architecture, and it has exercised a
               magnetism over architectural culture which is as strong today as
               it was at any point in the past. The interest originated in the
               mid-nineteenth century, but achieved a strong uptake in the early

               of prefabrication performance, there have been efforts to conduct
               industry-wide surveys and reports. The chapter presents an
               overview of the three surveys and provides a summary of each
               survey and the comparative overlaps. The main purpose of these
               surveys is to identify the key performance indicators associated
               with offsite construction. The surveys identify barriers and
               substantiate claims for the industry. The McGraw-Hill
               Construction survey did not directly ask questions regarding
               productivity; rather, the report has key interviews with
               construction industry leaders.",

               the concept of montage as a driver for establishing a new

               potential to unleash and introduce dynamics and tension in

               engender a new industrial conception of architecture. Off-site

               speed versus accuracy: developments in the realm of building

               Creating architectural dialogues between new and old, industrial

               reduce house price inflation. Within this setting, there has been
               much interest in the potential offered by off-site construction
               (OSC). The production strategies employed by private
               house-building firms however, are a direct response to their
               operational environment, and the adoption of OSC would arguably
               alter the way that they deliver their developments. Hence, there
               is a clear need to understand the relationship between production
               strategy and construction methods. Based on a case study of one
               of the largest private house-building firms in the UK, the
               potential impacts of OSC on current production strategies have
               been explored. The results indicate that the adoption of OSC
               approaches may alter the manner in which house-building firms are
               able to manage their production process, reducing their control
               and restricting the very flexibility on which their own success
               relies. The findings have implications for the housebuilding
               industry, OSC manufacturers and construction research, given the
               ongoing interest in OSC as a means to address the UK’s housing
               supply issues.",

  abstract  = "A vital and underappreciated dimension of social interaction is
               the way individuals justify their actions to others,
               instinctively drawing on their experience to appeal to principles
               they hope will command respect. Individuals, however, often
               misread situations, and many disagreements can be explained by
               people appealing, knowingly and unknowingly, to different
               principles. On Justification is the first English translation of
               Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot's ambitious theoretical
               examination of these phenomena, a book that has already had a
               huge impact on French sociology and is likely to have a similar
               influence in the English-speaking world. In this foundational
               work of post-Bourdieu sociology, the authors examine a wide range
               of situations where people justify their actions. The authors
               argue that justifications fall into six main logics exemplified
               by six authors: civic (Rousseau), market (Adam Smith), industrial
               (Saint-Simon), domestic (Bossuet), inspiration (Augustine), and
               fame (Hobbes). The authors show how these justifications
               conflict, as people compete to legitimize their views of a
               situation.On Justification is likely to spark important debates

  abstract  = "One of the issues organizations face is identifying the required
               skills needed for a position and then evaluating whether their
               personnel have these skills or if there is a “skills gap”. The
               skills gap is the distance between the position requirements and
               the skills currently possessed by the worker in that position.
               While multiple models have been created over the years to address
               facets of the problem, none of them provide a comprehensive
               framework to clearly identify the required skills and worker
               qualifications and then evaluate the degree of similarity. A
               composite skills gap model has been developed using the Design
               Science Research Method to combine elements of previous models
               and to ensure that the resulting model met a set of established
               criteria. The Skills Gap Analysis Model (SGAM) was evaluated
               using demonstration data to ensure that it provided a single
               taxonomy for both position requirements and the worker
               qualifications, the resulting descriptions were quantifiable and
               comparable, the data was accurate and actionable, the model
               framework is adaptable to any domain, and that it is easy to use
               and not time consuming. The framework provided by the model
               establishes a theoretical foundation for skills gap analyses that
               allows for more analytical research in this area. By utilizing
               the SGAM to identify position requirements and worker
               qualifications, organizations can move personnel to better suited
               positions or utilize needed training in the specific areas
               identified. As technology moves towards increasing automation,
               robotics and artificial intelligence, this type of model can
               identify what skills are necessary for “re-tooling” the workforce
               to meet the needs to support these systems.",

               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new
               business model is the transformation of an existing project-based
               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new

               presents a rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of
               how everyday market activity gets produced.If you’re convinced
               you know what a market is, think again. In his long-awaited
               study, French sociologist and engineer Michel Callon takes us to
               the heart of markets, to the unsung processes that allow
               innovations to become robust products and services. Markets in
               the Making begins with the observation that stable commercial
               transactions are more enigmatic, more elusive, and more involved
               than previously described by economic theory. Slicing through
               blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon presents a rigorously
               researched but counterintuitive model of market activity that
               emphasizes what people designing products or launching startups
               soon discover—the inherent difficulties of connecting individuals
               to things. Callon’s model is founded upon the notion of
               “singularization,” the premise that goods and services must adapt
               and be adapted to the local milieu of every individual whose life
               they enter. Person by person, thing by thing, Callon demonstrates
               that for ordinary economic transactions to emerge en masse,
               singular connections must be made.Pushing us to see markets as
               more than abstract interfaces where pools of anonymous buyers and
               sellers meet, Callon draws our attention to the exhaustively
               creative practices that market professionals continuously devise
               to entangle people and things. Markets in the Making exemplifies
               how prototypes, fragile curiosities that have only just been
               imagined, are gradually honed into predictable objects and
               practices. Once these are active enough to create a desired
               effect, yet passive enough to be transferred from one place to
               another without disruption, they will have successfully achieved
               the status of “goods” or “services.” The output of this more
               ample process of innovation, as redefined by Callon, is what we
               recognize as “the market”—commercial activity, at scale.The
               capstone of an influential research career at the forefront of
               science and technology studies, Markets in the Making coherently
               integrates the empirical perspective of product engineering with
               the values of the social sciences. After masterfully redescribing
               how markets are made, Callon culminates with a strong empirical
               argument for why markets can and should be harnessed to enact
               social change. His is a theory of markets that serves social
               critique.",

               papers has been to understand workplace learning and the ways in
               which it can be enhanced. By drawing on leading edge research
               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and

              ``Participatory Qualitative Research.'' In recent years there has
              been a resurgence of interest in participatory research
              strategies. The articles in this special issue come from different
              disciplines. Against the background of concrete empirical research
              projects, they address numerous conceptual considerations and
              methodological approaches. After reading the contributions, and
              engaging with the authors' arguments, we were prompted to focus in
              particular on those areas in which further work needs to be done.
              They include, on the one hand, fundamental principles of
              participatory research, such as democratic-theory considerations,
              the concept of ``safe space,'' participation issues, and ethical
              questions. And, on the other hand, we focus on practical research
              considerations regarding the role and tasks of the various
              participants; specific methodological approaches; and quality
              criteria—understood here in the sense of arguments justifying a
              participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a broad discussion
              that does not focus only on participatory research in the narrower
              sense. Because participatory methodology poses certain knowledge-
              and research-related questions in a radical way, it has the
              potential to draw attention to hitherto neglected areas in

               skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
               administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
               about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
               towards training. The survey intended to address the following
               research questions, specifically in relation to the construction
               industry. Findings – The survey results reveal that whilst
               overall participation in workplace training is high, the current
               workplace training environments do not foster balanced skill
               development. The study reveals that in the current absence of a
               formal and well-balanced training mechanism, construction workers
               generally resort to their own informal self-development
               initiatives to develop the needed role-specific theoretical
               knowledge. Research limitations/implications – The findings of
               the research are based on the data primarily collected in the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are
               limited to a single Tier 2 construction company. Practical
               implications – The findings of this study can be utilised to
               suggest improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
               training initiatives. Social implications – The research suggests
               that workplace training has positive relationship with career
               growth. The results suggest that in the construction industry,
               employees are generally well aware of the importance of workplace
               training in their career development and they largely appreciate
               training as being a critical factor for developing their capacity
               to perform their roles successfully, and to maintain their
               employability. Originality/value – This paper is unique as it
               investigates the current skills gap in both generic and skill
               areas within the construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               So far no work has been undertaken to identify and discusses the
               main method of workplace learning within the Tier 2 industry in

               of four different strategies for teaching three to four year old
               children how to master a difficult construction task. These
               strategies were derived from previous studies of mother-child and
               experimenter-child interactions in an assisted learning
               situation. One strategy the 'contingent approach' was based
               primarily on theoretical considerations and when used in earlier
               work as a basis for describing and evaluating maternal teaching
               it enabled us to predict how well children taught by their
               mothers would do with a task after instruction. The three other
               strategies are idealised versions of the teaching methods used by
               less successful mothers-as-teachers. On the basis of our analysis
               of effective instruction it is possible to predict how well
               children taught by these four different techniques by a trained
               instructor should perform after instruction.The present study
               largely confirms these predictions. In so doing, it strengthens
               the supposition that it was maternal behaviour in the earlier
               work which influenced the children's task abilities and it also
               corroborates various hypotheses about the essential nature of
               effective face-to-face instruction.",

               the performance of construction project delivery. While the
               construction industry is often labeled as conservative and
               unimaginative with regard to technology adoption, significant
               strides have been made in recent years  specifically, the use of
               Building Information Modeling (BIM) for information storage,
               distribution and communication, as well as Lean construction
               techniques such as production planning and control (PPC). While
               the implementation of these innovative technologies and practices
               individually improve project performance, integrating them
               together can provide still greater benefits. BIM is certainly
               useful, but it alone is not a satisfactory answer to the paradox:
               how does one design and visualize a 3D product in a 2D space?
               Augmented Reality (AR) is a disruptive technology that can help
               address this challenge. AR is both an aggregator of information
               and an information publishing platform which allows users a
               spectrum of capabilities to 1) passively view displayed
               information, 2) actively engage and interact with published
               content, and 3) collaborate with others in real time from remote
               locations. No extant research effort has comprehensively
               investigated the opportunities and benefits of the integrated use
               of AR, BIM, and Lean in the planning process to improve project
               performance. This paper addresses precisely this research gap.
               Using insights gained from real-world construction projects, this
               paper examines the current state of production strategy process
               (PSP) development  an integral part of PPC, identifies
               pain-points and opportunities for process re-engineering using
               AR, and develops an AR-enabled PSP future state.",

               knowledge is shaped by history, community and ontogeny through

               links social circumstances to the development of cognitive

               for lifelong learning in developing both routine and flexible

               elaboration of a comprehensive workplace learning theory,
               comprising a cognitive, a social and an emotional dimension.
               Qualitative case studies show that various factors in the
               different dimensions of learning influence the learning processes
               and outcomes in a diverse way. Especially more profound
               acquisition and development of abstract principles relating to
               flexible competence does not automatically take place during WPL.

               Such a climate actively militates against collective learning and

               obstacles to building in the places where new housing is needed
               most. And young people are increasingly viewing homeownership,
               once a vital part of the American dream, as hopelessly out of
               reach. These outcomes weren’t inevitable. Plenty of other
               countries supply their populations with high-quality housing at
               lower prices. And the solutions here are incredibly simple: Build
               more housing in places where it’s needed, build cheaper forms of
               housing, build housing alongside public transit, provide more
               housing vouchers. So why don’t we act on them?",

               disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis of
               the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most recent
               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and
               training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals how
               expertise is developed in an age of considerable transformation
               in work processes, work organization, and occupational
               identities. The authors also examine many of the challenges of
               vocational education and training such as the impact of digital
               technologies on employment, the demand for (re)training in the
               context of extended working lives, the emergence of learning

                 responsivity of vocational education. Responsivity is defined
                 as the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to
                 interpret socioeconomic and technological developments for
                 curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical approach.
                 VET needs to equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and
                 confidence to engage in work and make a difference in the
                 transformation of work. This chapter argues that learners have
                 to be provided with opportunities to actively engage in
                 innovation at work to experience what is needed to deal with
                 uncertainty and to organize their own learning in such
                 circumstances. In the Netherlands, the challenges of building
                 regional networks and participating in regional innovation are
                 being taken up by higher professional education (HPE). This
                 chapter describes the promising approach developed in the
                 Netherlands, which focuses on innovative work-based learning to
                 strengthen responsivity.",

  abstract  = "This paper explores the relationship between the way work is
               organised, the organisational context, and learning in the
               workplace. It develops, in part, from earlier work where we
               argued that organisations differ in the way they create and
               manage themselves as learning environments, with some
               conceptualised as expansive in the sense that their employees
               experience diverse forms of participation and, hence, are more
               likely to foster learning at work (see Fuller and Unwin, 2004).
               The paper argues that contemporary workplaces give rise to many
               different forms of learning, some of which is utilised to the
               benefit of the organisation and employees (though not,
               necessarily, in a reciprocal manner), but much of which is buried
               within everyday workplace activity. By studying the way in which
               work is organised (including the organisation of physical and
               virtual spaces), it is possible to expose some of this learning
               activity as well as examples of the creation of new (or refined)
               knowledge. Part of this process involves the breaking down of
               conceptual hierarchies that presuppose that learning is
               restricted to certain types of employee and/or parts of an
               organisation. This paper builds on the work of other researchers
               who highlight the importance of the context (see, inter alia,
               Nonaka et al, 2005; Boreham and Morgan, 2004; Unwin et al 2005).
               It also draws on the work of Engestrom (see, inter alia, 2001),
               who has highlighted the way new knowledge is created through
               employee interaction when problem solving and, hence, has paid
               attention to the important question of the quality of learning in
               the workplace. In addition, it builds on Wilkinsons (2002)
               conceptualisation of the way organisations construct, manage and
               respond to social relations of production that operate at a
               variety of levels in productive systems. The paper uses evidence
               from the learning as work project, which is based in public and
               private sector organisations in the UK.",

              and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use
              it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At
              the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital
              and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which
              enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously
              engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor
              because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always
              reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand
              even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are
              counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a
              comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the
              task content of production in favor of labor because of a
              reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor
              demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of
              production—due to automation and new tasks—can be inferred from
              industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the
              slower growth of employment over the last three decades is
              accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect,
              especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and
              slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.",

               seek ways in which to build workforce capacity. It can be
               dismissed as an anachronism in the light of the emergent
               discourse about the so-called knowledge economy and knowledge
               workers, as well as calls for greater occupational boundary
               crossing and multi-disciplinary/multi-skilled approaches to work.
               Knowledge workers are presumed to enter the workplace fully
               formed, armed with theoretical knowledge and (possibly) some work
               experience from their university degrees. In contrast,
               apprenticeship is positioned within an initial vocational
               education and training (IVET) paradigm and as a journey towards
               intermediate level expertise. Hence, for some, apprenticeship is
               an institutional arrangement between the state, employers and
               (sometimes) trades unions to train young people. For others,

              systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITSs). This
              paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed
              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,
              Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases.
              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
              intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
              enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction, evaluate
              learners, define and update the learner’s model, and classify or
              cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of the system,
              learner’s performance, and experiences were used for evaluation of
              ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user interfaces. Although
              these systems could facilitate reasoning in the learning process,
              these systems have rarely been applied in experimental courses
              including problem-solving, decision-making in physics, chemistry,
              and clinical fields. Due to the important role of a cell phone in
              facilitating personalized learning and given the low rate of using
              mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development and

               event with three principal characteristics - It is unpredictable;
               it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an
               explanation that makes it appear less random, and more
               predictable, than it was. Why do we not acknowledge the
               phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the
               answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn
               specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We
               concentrate on things we already know and time and time again
               fail to take into consideration what we don't know. We are,
               therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable

               2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really
               feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual
               world where most of humanity spends their days. When the
               eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of
               fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of
               decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his
               vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself. Then Wade cracks
               the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take

               and form. Past approaches no longer sustain new demands and
               require innovative thinking. The need for a new outlook is
               propelled by fundamental changes that touch upon environmental,
               economic and social aspects. The depletion of non-renewable
               natural resources and climate change are a few of the
               environmental challenges. Increasing costs of material, labor,
               land and infrastructure have posed economic challenges with
               affordability being paramount among them. Social challenges are
               also drawing the attention of designers, builders and homeowners.
               Walkable communities, aging in place and multigenerational living
               are some of the concepts considered. In addition, live-work

               Magazine's top 100 non-fiction books written in English since

               Robert Skidelsky, this important work is made available to a new

               transformed economics and changed the face of modern
               macroeconomics. Keynes’ argument is based on the idea that the
               level of employment is not determined by the price of labour, but
               by the spending of money. It gave way to an entirely new approach
               where employment, inflation and the market economy are concerned.
               Highly provocative at its time of publication, this book and
               Keynes’ theories continue to remain the subject of much support
               and praise, criticism and debate. Economists at any stage in

               what neurodiversity is, why it's important and what the benefits

               the 2 in 10 employees in the UK who are neurodiverse, can reach
               their full potential. Neurodiversity at Work is packed full of

               reveal our priorities and ambitions, our family structures and

               architecture has been shaped in every era by our access to

               academic, capped by sharing the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics
               and the Nobel Peace Prize, and honorary degrees from Harvard,
               Cambridge, Oxford and more than fifty other universities, and
               elected not only to the National Academy of Sciences and the
               American Academy of Arts and Letters but the Royal Society and
               the British Academy; a public servant, who served as Chair of
               President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and Chief
               Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank, headed
               international commissions for the UN and France, and was awarded
               the French Legion of Honor and Australia's Sydney Peace Prize; a
               public intellectual whose numerous books on vital topics have
               been best sellers. What brought him to economics were his
               concerns about the inequality and discrimination he saw growing
               up. Wanting to understand what drives it and what can be done
               about it has been his lifelong passion. This book gathers
               together and extends to new frontiers this lifelong work, drawing
               upon the challenges and insights of each of these phases of his
               career. In a still very widely cited paper written fifty years
               ago, Stiglitz set forth the fundamental framework for analyzing
               intergenerational transfer of wealth and advantage, which plays a
               central role in persistent inequality. That and subsequent work,
               developed most fully here for the first time, described today's
               inequality as a result of centrifugal forces increasing
               inequality and centripetal forces reducing it. In recent decades,
               the centrifugal forces have strengthened, the centripetal forces
               weakened. His general theory provides a framework for
               understanding the marked growth in inequality in recent decades,
               and for devising policies to reduce it. A central message is that
               ever-increasing inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is, in a
               fundamental sense, a choice. Stiglitz explains that inequality
               does not largely arise from differences in savings rates between
               capitalists and others, though that may play a role (as Piketty,
               Marx, and Kaldor suggest); but rather, it originates importantly
               from the rules of the game, which have weakened the bargaining
               power of workers as they have increased the market power of
               corporations. He also explains how monetary authorities have
               contributed to increasing wealth inequality, and how, unless
               something is done about it, likely changes in technology such as
               AI and robotization will make matters worse. He describes
               policies that can simultaneously reduce inequality and improve
               economic performance.",

                 including rights to health, education, water and sanitation,
                 freedom of association and freedom of expression, and the right
                 to life itself. It is one of the underlying key capabilities,
                 which Amartya Sen argues is required for opportunities to be
                 harnessed (Sen 1985). The United Nations has determined that
                 the right to adequate housing should not be interpreted
                 narrowly, such as being limited to having shelter or viewed
                 exclusively as a commodity, but rather it is to be understood
                 in a far broader sense: the right to live in peace, security
                 and dignity (UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
                 Rights 1991). Realising this right in practice, however,
                 requires new thinking and new policies. The stark reality is
                 that we are a long way from achieving this goal. Our paper
                 suggests that to make this ambition real, we must bring a human
                 rights approach together with new economic thinking and
                 mission-oriented—outcomes-driven— economic policies. These
                 frameworks can reinforce one another. While the former invokes
                 legal accountability for ensuring adequate housing for all in
                 support of human flourishing, the latter organises and
                 accelerates the multi-stakeholder, whole-of-government action
                 required to meet this obligation. The United Nations
                 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving ‘access for all
                 to adequate, safe and affordable housing’ (SDG 11.1) can
                 provide a north star orientation for this new policy approach.
                 But achieving it requires unpicking the relationships between
                 current actors. It requires governments to set bold missions
                 that catalyse cross-sectoral investment and collaboration, to
                 embrace their role as market-shapers, to align public sector
                 tools, institutions and finance with these missions, and to
                 design partnerships – including with the private sector – that

               implementation lags. While a case can be made for each
               explanation, we argue that lags have likely been the biggest
               contributor to the paradox. The most impressive capabilities of
               AI, particularly those based on machine learning, have not yet
               diffused widely. More importantly, like other general purpose
               technologies, their full effects won’t be realized until waves of
               complementary innovations are developed and implemented. The
               adjustment costs, organizational changes, and new skills needed
               for successful AI can be modeled as a kind of intangible capital.
               Some of the value of this intangible capital is already reflected
               in the market value of firms. However, going forward, national
               statistics could fail to measure the full benefits of the new
               technologies and some may even have the wrong sign.",

  abstract = "This thesis describes the results of research aimed at exploring
              the relationship between three different practices to improve
              product development: Concurrent Engineering (CE), New Product
              Development (NPD), and Project Management (PM). The literature on
              each approach is abundant, yet studies explaining their
              inter-relationship are scanty and contradictory. Therefore, the
              main contribution of this thesis is explanation and clarification
              of contradictory theories and perspectives. In exploring this
              relationship four cases studies were developed in companies that
              were applying these practices. Principles of the grounded theory
              and qualitative research were applied to gather and analyse data.
              The results suggest that CE, NPD, and PM are relatively different
              in practice and purpose and therefore they can be complementary to
              each other. However, because of a lack of clearer definitions and
              boundaries they are sometimes considered competing approaches, as
              has been observed both in the literature and in practice. CE, NPD,
              and PM were difficult to perceive as a sub-component one of the
              other as has been suggested in the literature. Rather,
              inter-linked process models seemed to better explain how the
              inter-relationship was understood and applied. The data gathered
              from the case studies suggest cause-effect relationships that may
              guide practitioners to implement or improve their product
              development practices. The investigation explores the essence,
              purpose and the knowledge generation process of CE, NPD and PM. It
              is suggested that NPD has a higher level of maturity than CE and
              NPD. This suggestion and the corresponding discussion is thought
              to be a contribution of current philosophical debates on the
              subject areas thereby nurturing the research agenda.",

              (PMS) to monitor their performance, assess the success of
              strategies, and/or assist the implementation of change programmes
              for continuous improvement. Performance measurement research has
              significantly evolved from developing conceptual frameworks (e.g.
              balanced scorecard) to rethinking and verifying the effects of PMS
              that is contextualised within the organisation. Inspite of
              significant evolution, PMS remains contentious conceptually and
              challenging for practitioners, especially in construction where
              theory and practice face contextual opportunities and constraints.
              While the approaches of key performance indicators (KPIs) and
              project performance benchmarks are predominating in construction
              research and practice, a systematic investigation of the
              conceptual basis of PMS is lacking in the construction context.
              This research examines the challenges for PMS theory and practice.
              Specifically, it aims to provide theoretical verification and
              convincing evidence pertaining to the extent to which key
              attributes of PMS lead to any positive effects in the construction
              context. By conducting a mixed methods research (i.e. a
              questionnaire survey and three case studies in UK construction
              firms), this study finds: three attributes are crucial for
              explicitly anatomising PMS – the nature, process quality and the
              use; all of them can separately lead to positive effects on
              sustaining project management and financial performance of
              construction firms, whereas PMS process quality plays a
              predominant role; both the nature of PMS and PMS process quality
              are the prerequisites of the extant use of PMS, which further
              improves system users’ perceived effectiveness of PMS; and
              finally, both institutional and organisational contexts largely
              shape and affect the adoption of PMS (the nature and process
              quality in particular). This study primarily contributes to
              systematically explicating the conceptual basis and effectiveness
              of PMS in the construction context and thereby uncovering the
              black box of how PMS affects organisational performance in

  abstract = "Organisational culture has been a long-standing debate in
              management research. However, in the field of construction project
              management, it is relatively under-explored. This is mainly due to
              the different organisational context of Temporary
              Multi-Organisations (TMOs). This research re-explores the notion
              of organisational culture in construction projects. Based on
              Darwin’s theory of evolution this research goes back to the very
              beginning; illustrating the exact meaning and dynamics of
              organisational culture in a construction TMO’s ecosystem. This
              research view an organisation and its forming of culture(s) as
              part of an evolutionary process. Thus, a critical realist’ view of
              causation is used as the foundation of the research design and
              methodology. Case study materials are provided from three
              Alliancing TMOs belonging to two major infrastructure clients in
              the UK. A designer culture model and the institutional theory are
              drawn upon to complement the basis of analysis for evolution. A
              qualitative research method is employed through semi-structured
              interviews and pre- and post-interview meetings. Other supporting
              documentations are also consulted. Three propositions and a
              postulate are generated and examined against the empirical data.
              Findings suggest that (i) the TMOs’ culture evolves through a set
              of recursive stages across the project lifecycle, (ii) the culture
              of the TMO undergoes several lifecycles during one lifespan of the
              project, and (iii) there are some evidence that culture at TMO
              level is learned, rationalised and routinised at corporate level.
              The postulate shows that it is plausible to predict the trajectory
              of how a TMO’s culture will evolve across the project lifecycle
              given a set of organisational features. In practice, findings
              suggest that hard artifacts alone are not able to sustain

              limited in exploring the psychology behind the intuitive risk

              Greater awareness of the owner and their supply network
              capabilities to mitigate failure could reduce significant quality
              costs that can amount to many millions of pounds. This thesis
              investigates why assets handed over to the owner have failed
              during operation, and proposes new ways that capabilities can be
              integrated to reduce and prevent potential operational failure
              from arising. An abductive reasoning with a grounded theory
              approach was used over a three-year period, and involved quarterly
              expert research steering group meetings to validate the iteration
              between literature and empirical observation to obtain new
              insights. The first workshop and questionnaire phase of the study
              created a Cost of Quality (COQ) framework; this was then tested on
              five multi-case study and subsequently developed within a single
              expert owner organisation using semi-structured interviews, card
              sorting and a Delphi review. The results show that the owner and
              the multi-organisational supply network capabilities are
              fragmented in addressing operational failure. By identifying and
              measuring quality cost failure, owners and their supply network
              will learn and be able to procure more integrated capabilities in
              failure mitigation for reducing quality cost failure. This will be

              functional operations management capabilities, which is summarised

              a strategic project and quality management approach to integrate
              capabilities within each phase of a project’s lifecycle. An
              integrated capabilities approach is proposed for the owner and its
              multi-organisational supply and operator network to integrate and

  author   = "Almadhoob, Huda Mohamed Ali Hasan Husain",
  abstract = "Managing large infrastructure projects remains a thorny issue in
              theory and practice. This is mainly due to their increasingly
              interconnected, interdependent, multilateral, nonlinear,
              unpredictable, uncontrollable, and rapidly changing nature. This
              study is an attempt to demystify the key issues to the management
              of large construction projects, arguing that these projects are
              delivered through networks that evolve in ways that we do not
              sufficiently understand as yet. The theoretical framework of this
              study is grounded in Complexity Theory; a theory resulted in a
              paradigm shift when it was first introduced to project management
              post-2000 but is yet to be unpacked in its full potential. The
              original contribution of the study is predicated on perceiving
              large construction projects as evolving complex systems that
              involves a high degree of self‐organisation. This is a process
              that transitions contractually static prescribed roles to dynamic
              network roles, comprising individuals exchanging information.
              Furthermore, by placing great emphasis upon informal
              communications, this study demonstrates how self-organising
              networks can be married with Complexity Theory. This approach has
              the potential to make bedfellows around the concept of managing
              networks within a context of managing projects; a concept that is
              not always recognised, especially in project management. With the
              help of social network analysis, two snapshots from Bank Station
              Capacity Upgrade Project Network were analysed as a case study.
              Findings suggest that relationships and hence network structures
              in large construction projects exhibit small-world topology,
              underlined by a high degree of sparseness and clustering. These
              are distinct structural properties of self-organising networks.
              Evidence challenges the theorisation about self-organisation which
              largely assumes positive outcomes and suggests that
              self-organising could open up opportunities yet also create
              constraints. This helps to provide further insights into
              complexity and the treatment of uncertainty in large projects. The

              procurement with Design, Bid, Build delivery was combined with
              standards and guidance; (2) dysfunctional integration – where the
              adoption of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) with Design and Build
              delivery transferred traditional roles and reduced
              standardisation; (3 and 4) adaptive integration 1 and 2 – which
              saw both a gradual deregulation of standards; and, an
              understanding for standards, and (5) the fifth temporal
              disintegration period – where guidance from the wider delivery
              model ceased to be updated due to top down policy reorganisation
              and lack of centralised control and includes a current case study.
              Throughout these temporal periods, it was found that the national

              Building Information Modelling (BIM) is prominently chosen by the
              built environment organisations. This innovation presents a great
              challenge for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It
              renders existing working paradigms obsolete and digitally
              transforms built environment businesses. The lack of individuals
              with adequate BIM competence is a major problem. Project-Based
              Learning (PBL) is a potential solution. This research aims to
              investigate BIM learning in projects in the built environment
              SMEs. The study examines knowledge practices used in projects and
              how they are exercised together in forming a project-based
              learning mechanism of BIM. 31 designers and engineers from the
              British and the Thai design and engineering SME consultancies are
              interviewed. Knowledge practices are identified based on their
              significance, while associations between them are analysed.
              Informal meeting, Knowledge team creation, and Standardisation
              play a crucial role in BIM learning in projects. Informal meeting
              and Knowledge team creation relate to tacit knowledge learning and
              exploration. Standardisation encourages explicit knowledge
              learning and exploitation. A project-based learning mechanism of
              BIM is formed through an interconnected system of knowledge
              practices. The connections among knowledge practices are found as
              assistive and correlative. The project-based learning mechanisms
              of BIM identified within this research are ambidextrous through
              the variety of knowledge practices being exercised together.
              Additionally, they can be further categorised as Exploitative,
              Ambidextrous, and Explorative. Practical suggestions are provided
              for BIM managers to increase attention towards the employment of
              certain knowledge practices and the creation of project-based
              learning mechanisms of BIM. Informal meeting, Knowledge team
              creation, and Standardisation are recommended for managers of BIM
              and other innovations. Innovation managers can balance
              ambidexterity by utilising an array of knowledge practices to
              encourage both exploitation and exploration. Proactive and
              tangible support such as the implementation of guidelines and
              protocols from the public sector in developing countries will
              promote BIM learning in organisations and encourage industry-wide
              adoption.",

  author   = "Sassano, Giuseppe",
  abstract = "Optimism bias affects most estimation based human decisions, from
              daily activities to the appraisal of big infrastructure projects.
              Building upon the underlying constructs of this behaviour through
              the lenses of support and prospect theories, operationalised in
              the internal and external view in the project management context,
              helped me to formulate a conceptual framework. This framework,
              called the “Holistic view” suggests ways to integrate the two
              perspectives with the aim to improve the quality of forecasts in
              infrastructure management. Integration can be achieved by
              including subjective probabilities and unpacking techniques into
              case-based reasoning methods. Based on this framework and on the
              analysis of the relevant policies, perspectives, definitions and
              techniques provided by the literature on optimism bias in project
              forecasting, I designed and administered four experiments, with a
              sample of 231 participants. The results of the first experiment
              show that there is a positive relationship between different
              levels of dispositional optimism and resource overruns. In the
              second experiment, I found that adding an optimism uplift to an
              estimate structurally increases forecast precision, however, this
              might lead to the use of more resources than when optimism uplift
              is not applied. In the third experiment, I found that unpacking,
              whilst making estimations slightly more precise, does not
              influence the estimations as in the previous case, but only the
              estimator. The results of the fourth experiment, combining
              unpacking with optimism uplift, indicated that forecast precision
              starkly increased, supporting the adoption of an “Holistic view”.
              This research shows the relevance of experimental methods in
              project management, unveils new relationships between different
              perspectives in the project forecasting field, and analyses, net
              of other factors, the impact of forecasting tools integrated in
              some of the policies addressing the effect of optimism bias in
              estimations, suggesting ways to improve those and the overall
              forecasting process of infrastructure projects.",

              and integrated design approaches such as Design for Manufacture
              and Assembly (DfMA). Within the context of China, there is a need
              for stronger implementation of digital technologies and DfMA, as
              well as a knowledge gap regarding how digital-enabled DfMA is
              implemented. More critically, an integrated approach is needed in
              addition to DfMA guidelines and digital-enabled approaches. For
              this research, a mixed method was used. Questionnaires defined the
              context of Huoshenshan Hospital, namely the healthcare
              construction in China. Then, Huoshenshan Hospital provided a case
              study of the first emergency hospital which addressed the
              uncertainty of COVID-19. This extreme project, a 1,000-bed
              hospital built in 10 days, implemented DfMA in healthcare
              construction and provides an opportunity to examine the use of
              modularity. A workshop with a design institution provided basic
              facts and insight into past practice and was followed by
              interviews with 18 designers, from various design disciplines, who
              were involved in the project. Finally, multiple archival materials
              were used as secondary data sources. It was found that complexity
              hinders building systems integration, while reinforcement
              relationships between multiple dimensions of modularity (across
              organisation-process-product-supply chain dimensions) are the
              underlying mechanism that allows for the reduction of complexity
              and the integration of building systems. Promoting integrated
              approaches to DfMA relies on adjusting and coupling
              multi-dimensional modular reinforcement relationships (namely,
              relationships of modular alignment, modular complement, and
              modular incentive). Thus, the building systems integrator can use
              these three approaches to increase the success of digital-enabled
              DfMA.",

  title    = "The Timing of Patterning or the Patterning of Timing?
              Organisational Routines in Temporary Organisations",
  author   = "Addyman, Simon",
  abstract = "Large, or mega, construction project organisations are temporary
              in nature and traditionally structured around a life cycle model
              consisting of predefined, time bound sequential stages of work
              that are designed to process information and reduce uncertainty.
              Yet as organising through projects becomes both more prevalent and
              challenging, it could be argued that such a model constrains our
              understanding and representation of what ‘actually’ happens beyond
              these deterministic structures and prescriptive routines,
              specifically in understanding ‘how’ construction project
              organisations transition through the predefined time boundaries of
              the sequential stages. This thesis contributes to this knowledge
              by identifying an alternative image of the life cycle model
              through empirically investigating the ‘transition’ between life
              cycle stages, with ‘incomplete’ information. It identifies a five
              stage ‘recursive process model of transitioning’ that highlights
              the underlying generative mechanisms involved in the (re)creation
              of organisational routines in managing the incompleteness
              associated with transitioning from one life cycle stage to the
              next. It presents an empirical autoethnographic case study over
              one year, observing a construction project organisation as it
              sought to transition from its design stage, through formal
              sanction, and into its construction stage. Informed ontologically
              by process metaphysics, and through challenging the underlying
              theoretical temporal assumptions of temporary organisations -
              ‘newness’, and organisational routines - ‘repetition’, it
              describes managing project transitions as ‘dialogical action’,
              influenced by the spatiotemporal aspects of the organising
              inquiry. It identifies the patterning of action within six
              transition routines, that when mapped over time present the five
              stage recursive process model of transition. Despite a successful
              three-year relationship in developing organisational capability
              between the client and the contractor in the design stage, as the
              pre-defined date for the commencement of the construction stage
              neared, there emerged a realisation of the impending uncertainty
              that this new stage would bring. Triggered by various formal and
              informal transition ‘rituals’, the organisations’ search for, and
              assumptions about the ‘sufficient completeness’, or ‘necessary
              incompleteness’ of information led to both the effortful and
              emergent (re)creation in the ‘patterning of dialogic action’ from
              the design stage, into the construction stage.",

               Approach to the Evaluation of New Procurement and Management
               Strategies",

  abstract  = "The aim of this thesis is to propose a new approach to the
               analysis and visualisation of reforms in procurement and project
               management systems within the UK construction industry. The
               subject matter chosen was inspired by the publication of the
               Latham Report (Latham, 1994) and personal experience within the
               construction industry within one of the roles currently in
               transition. Certain limitations within existing methodologies
               employed by those who have sought to analyse construction
               procurement and management (for example, Higgin and Jessop, 1965;
               Masterman, 1992; Franks, 1998 and Cleland and King, 1983), are
               identified. These limitations are associated with the
               interdependence of roles, appropriateness of detail, uniformity
               of presentation and the difficulty of quantification in the
               context of a non-linear, complex, iterative, interactive,
               non-hierarchical process that construction comprises.
               Conceptually the research draws together Winch's model of the
               construction project team as a temporary project coalition
               (Winch, 1983:36) and Williamson's nexus of treaties (in Aoki,
               1992:1). The research proposes that current dramatic changes in
               procurement and management strategies might be observed and
               analysed if the construction project is conceptualised as a
               network of relationships existing between the firms that comprise
               the project coalition. These relationships are contractual, those
               associated with performance incentives and those associated with
               information exchanges (the latter classified into the main
               functions that the project team must perform - design
               development, cost and progress management). It is proposed that
               social network analysis (SNA) be used to investigate these
               networks. Following a pilot study involving the BAA ``Genesis''
               project, four case studies were carried out. Two control studies
               involved traditional procurement; a further two represented
               projects utilising partnering, supply chain management and work
               clusters, and involving two of the UK's largest and most
               innovative clients. Analysis of the data focussed upon the use of
               centrality (a measure of prominence within a network), as a means
               of quantifying changing roles within the coalition and the
               relationships between the firms providing these roles. The
               research established that SNA is a very effective tool for
               research into procurement and management. Findings suggest that
               the changing prominence of existing roles and the evolution of
               certain hybrid roles are readily quantified and graphically
               represented using SNA; centrality is ideally suited to look into
               the leverage that project actors exert within the construction
               project supply chain; findings challenge some existing views on
               the desirability and nature of fragmentation within the UK
               construction industry; findings also suggest that the two new
               procurement projects deal with the governance of their respective
               coalitions in very different ways; a single, prominent actor is
               needed to manage the supply chain; traditional construction roles
               are changing rapidly - cost management, design dislocation and
               the new role of cluster leader are all important issues.",

               (IT) and productivity by investigating several plant-level
               mechanisms through which IT could promote productivity growth. We
               have assembled a data set on plants with a common production
               technology in a narrowly defined industry - valve manufacturing -
               to study the effects of new IT on product innovation, production
               process improvements, employee skills and work practices. The
               homogeneity of the plants' production processes within this
               narrowly defined industry together with the estimation of
               longitudinal models eliminate many sources of unmeasured

               adoption of new IT-enhanced equipment (1)alters business

               production based on long production runs to customized production

               What if you stopped trying to do everything, so that you could
               finally get round to what counts?We're obsessed with our
               lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, the struggle
               against distraction, and the sense that our attention spans are
               shrivelling. Still, we rarely make the connection between our
               daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management
               problem: the question of how best to use our ridiculously brief
               time on the planet, which amounts on average to about four
               thousand weeks. Four Thousand Weeks is an uplifting, engrossing
               and deeply realistic exploration of the challenge. Rejecting the
               futile modern obsession with 'getting everything done,' it
               introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by
               embracing rather than denying their limitations. And it shows how
               the unhelpful ways we've come to think about time aren't
               inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we've made, as
               individuals and as a society. Its many revelations will transform

               doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is
               happening? In Construction Management and Economics and
               elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars on
               the topic of innovation in construction – but what of
               transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so – how?
               We set out with this Special Issue to answer these questions and
               advance the theoretical understanding of the transformation of
               the built environment, and how this requires the construction
               industry to transform accordingly. We believe that a
               “transforming construction” research agenda entails a
               multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on
               industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and
               project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise the
               process focus in contemporary social science through our framing
               of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by seeking
               out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice. This resulting
               Special Issue will hopefully act as a provocation for new
               perspectives on transforming construction: it attempts to
               revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we conceptualise both
               construction and construction research. The eight papers build on
               a strong legacy of research on innovation in construction
               management, while providing new insights on what is being
               transformed and how; locating, albeit tentatively, where the
               future debates are; and identifying spaces where rich data may be
               found. Readers will find a stimulating range of conceptual
               thinking and empirical evidence being brought to bear on change,
               innovation, and transformation, with extensive discussion of
               implications for future research on construction policy,
               projects, and people, broadening our field of view and drawing
               out strong new ideas to guide practice. The structure of this
               Editorial is as follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of
               key themes within the transforming construction topic, as
               outlined in the Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the
               content of the eight accepted papers, positioning each paper
               under one of three headings, which reflect the multi-scale
               perspective of the Special Issue and as presented previously in
               the Call for Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in
               which we set out what we see as five major themes emerging from
               the papers, characterising what transforming construction looks
               like from the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion
               section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most
               pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some
               direction to future research in the area, followed by a short

  abstract = "Construction is traditionally a trade that produces unique,
              one-off products designed specifically for individual projects via
              an engineer-to-order process. However, recently developed flexible
              product platforms based on the theory of mass customisation offer
              product flexibility with affordable costs. The degree of
              commonality between products can also be increased by applying the
              products-in-products concept. This study aims to conceptualise and
              test theories of mass customisation through modularisation for
              applications in the construction industry. Three case studies on
              building and infrastructure construction projects using different
              specification processes (modify-to-order, configure-to-order and
              select-variant) are presented. The results show that the
              products-in-products concept is useful for enabling mass
              customisation in construction. While select-variant specification
              is compatible with relatively integral designs, the architecture
              must have a modular structure to enable modify-to-order or
              configure-to-order customisation.",

                 higher earnings brackets over the course of a career. Building
                 human capital also pays off for firms in the form of more

                 addition to being more consistent than their sector peers,

  abstract    = "In 1966, the philosopher Michael Polanyi observed, ``We can
                 know more than we can tell... The skill of a driver cannot be
                 replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar;
                 the knowledge I have of my own body differs altogether from the
                 knowledge of its physiology.'' Polanyi's observation largely
                 predates the computer era, but the paradox he identified--that
                 our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our
                 explicit understanding--foretells much of the history of
                 computerization over the past five decades. This paper offers a
                 conceptual and empirical overview of this evolution. I begin by
                 sketching the historical thinking about machine displacement of
                 human labor, and then consider the contemporary incarnation of
                 this displacement--labor market polarization, meaning the
                 simultaneous growth of high-education, high-wage and
                 low-education, low-wages jobs--a manifestation of Polanyi's
                 paradox. I discuss both the explanatory power of the
                 polarization phenomenon and some key puzzles that confront it.
                 I then reflect on how recent advances in artificial
                 intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the
                 likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.
                 A key observation of the paper is that journalists and expert
                 commentators overstate the extent of machine substitution for
                 human labor and ignore the strong complementarities. The
                 challenges to substituting machines for workers in tasks
                 requiring adaptability, common sense, and creativity remain
                 immense. Contemporary computer science seeks to overcome
                 Polanyi's paradox by building machines that learn from human
                 examples, thus inferring the rules that we tacitly apply but do
                 not explicitly understand.",

               growth, damages the environment, and promotes long commutes,
               traffic jams, misery, and smog. Yet instead of a serious focus on
               the issue, America’s cities feature niche conversations about the
               availability of “affordable housing” for poor people. Yglesias’s

               newfound context for the issue and real-time, practical solutions

               pandemic, to defend ourselves against global threats—it is
               faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital
               age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome
               than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap
               between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get. But it’s
               not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a
               rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy
               from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the
               details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as
               they cascade through a complex hierarchy. But there is an
               approach taking hold that keeps pace with today’s world and
               reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve.
               Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must stop trying to move the
               government we have today onto new technology and instead consider
               what it would mean to truly recode American government.",

              affordable housing amidst the post‑war economic boom. However, the

              financing, particularly the limited access for people of color to
              FHA loans. Over time, the community faced economic downturns,
              crime, and a declining sense of identity, reflecting broader
