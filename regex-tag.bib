               teaching is not treated as a design profession. Every day,
               teachers design and test new ways of teaching, using learning

               remain local. By representing and communicating their best ideas

               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as *offsite construction*. A

               researchers who study the transformation of practice through the
               enhancement and transformation of expertise. This is an important
               moment for such a contribution because expertise is in transition
               - moving toward collaboration in inter-organizational fields and
               continuous shaping of transformations. To understand and master
               this transition, powerful new conceptual tools are needed and are
               provided here. The theoretical framework which has shaped these
               studies is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). CHAT
               analyses how people and organisations learn to do something new,
               and how both individuals and organisations change. The
               theoretical and methodological tools used have their origins in
               the work of Lev Vygotsky and A.N. Leont’ev. In recent years this
               body of work has aroused significant interest across the social
               sciences, management and communication studies. Working as part
               of an integrated international team, the authors identify
               specific findings which are of direct interest to the academic
               community, such as: the analysis of vertical learning between
               operational and strategic levels within complex organizations;
               the refinement of notions of identity and subject position within
               CHAT; the introduction of the concept of ‘labour power’ into
               CHAT; the development of a method of analysing discourse which
               theoretically coheres with CHAT and the design of projects.
               Activity Theory in Practice will be highly useful to
               practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who are
               interested in conceptual and empirical issues in all aspects of

               vocational education necessitates placing individuals centrally
               in those deliberations. The geneses of national vocational
               education systems, and their form, goals, and practices, are
               increasingly shaped by institutional factors, which Dewey (1916)
               refers to as the ?social side.? They extend to the provision of
               detailed national prespecified outcomes, course content, forms of
               assessment, and so on. Yet, the efficacy and continuity of these
               educational provisions arise in response to how individuals
               engage, learn, and remake them?what Dewey refers to as the
               ?personal side??albeit in interdependent ways. That is, there is
               mutual dependence between the personal and social sides.
               Regardless of whether it is directed to pragmatic purposes or
               educational efficacy, vocational education relies on individual

               introducing the potentials and affordances of technologies as a

               is used, developed, and sustained (over time) in practice. It
               argues that the development of teachers? expertise in vocational

               residing both within the individual as personal expertise and/or
               within networks as shared vocational knowledge. The chapter
               employs two different but complementary research methodologies
               (cultural historical activity theory and actor?network theory) as
               analytical lenses to explore and make visible the phenomenon of
               vocational practice in action. Examples are given from a range of
               case studies of both vocational trainee teachers and experienced
               vocational teachers. The chapter concludes by arguing for new
               ways to approach the development of vocational teachers?

               the strength and nature of the relationship between education,

               socioeconomic and institutional change that underpin debates
               about the concept of occupation and its changing relationship
               with apprenticeship. The discussion draws on two contrasting

               affect the nature and quality of the associated apprenticeships.

               programs of publicly funded vocational learning (including
               apprenticeships) and the qualifications associated with them need
               to generate hybrid benefits, through providing a vehicle for the

               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this
               groundbreaking text, as it gives the intellectual tools required
               to understand how learning in the workplace can be improved.},

               low-wage workers, both employed and unemployed, effected through
               the widespread use of ‘basic skills’ assessments. Employers are
               increasingly using literacy, numeracy and language skills
               assessments as the basis of hiring decisions as well as a range
               of other employment decisions, including promotion, assignment or
               reassignment, and firing. Assessment is used in ‘workplace basic
               skills’ programmes, both in the ‘needs assessment’ phase prior to
               the establishment of programmes and in the post-programmes
               ‘learning assessment’ phase. In the workplace, the unequal nature
               of the employment relationship and the requirement for programmes
               of education or training to have a measurable impact on
               profitability tend to conflict with the need for the
               dispassionate and unthreatening assessment required in programmes
               of fundamental education. This tendency has been magnified in the
               recent past as performance on literacy, numeracy and language
               proficiency assessments has been interpreted as a consummate
               indicator of ‘fitness’ for work. The chapter concludes that the
               use of ‘basic skills’ assessments represents an area of
               fundamental conflict between capital and labour and that, in
               cases where training programmes are designed to remediate basic
               skills ‘deficiencies’, the quality of the training itself is
               frequently as problematic as the assessment.},

               are acquired and used. In particular, performance in the
               workplace typically involves the integration of several different
               forms of knowledge and skill, under conditions that allow little
               time for the analytic/deliberative approach favoured in higher
               education. One consequence is greater reliance on tacit
               knowledge, including knowledge of how more formal, explicit
               knowledge is used in various practice settings. The second half

               understanding and positive commitment from individual learners,
               formal education, employers and local workplace managers.

               distinctive characteristics and learning challenges are discussed
               in some detail. The neglect of transfer is attributed both to the

               scientific research to objectively identify effective learning,
               in the workplace as elsewhere, for example by measuring the
               attainments of such learning. Drawing upon empirical data, we
               argue that this is counter-productive. Workplace learning is
               complex, yet a research focus on measured attainments implicitly
               defines such learning in a narrow way, within an acquisition
               perspective. This severely restricts the range of learning that
               can be recognized. Ironically, the very types of learning likely
               to be excluded are some of the most common and significant. To
               gain a better understanding of workplace learning and to
               effectively improve it, we need to resist scientific
               reductionism, and work with more holistic theoretical and

               trainings have been shown to be a promising approach to support
               experience-based learning, as the virtual environments can
               simulate realistic work environments. To investigate to which
               extent reflective learning can be supported by using VR
               simulations, this exploratory study combines a VR simulation on a
               construction site with subsequent semi-structured interviews to
               induce reflections in participants. Results of the qualitative
               content analysis show, that a reflection process about work
               safety aspects benefits from combining VR simulation with a
               subsequent interview. Numerous reflections on the content of the
               simulation coupled to own past (real-life) experience were
               induced, indicating the tested combination to be a promising
               learning approach to teach work safety aspects that may help to
               raise the awareness about work safety at construction sites.},

               and development and industrial relations. As the skills agenda
               has moved to the forefront of public conversation, in a practical
               sense training and development have become more of an industrial
               relations concern, as policymakers exhort the social actors to
               cooperate and build new partnership relations around skills,
               training, and learning to help address the challenges of building
               more productive economies. The chapter considers the conceptual
               underpinnings of the industrial relations of training, before
               reviewing developments in the British training system, notably in
               terms of trade union?led learning initiatives, within a more
               comparative context. The analysis suggests that the industrial
               relations of training are heavily influenced by the institutional
               structures and legacies that help to regulate potential conflicts
               of interest around training and development. However, ?mutual

               done in organizations. Find out why Adam Grant says "If every
               leader took the ideas in this book seriously, the world would be
               a less miserable, more productive place." Every organization is
               plagued by destructive friction. Yet some forms of friction are
               incredibly useful, and leaders who attempt to improve workplace
               efficiency often make things even worse. Drawing from seven years
               of hands-on research, The Friction Project by bestselling authors
               Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao teaches readers how to become
               "friction fixers." Sutton and Rao kick off the book by unpacking
               how skilled friction fixers think and act like trustees of
               others' time. They provide friction forensics to help readers
               identify where to avert and repair bad organizational friction
               and where to maintain and inject good friction. Then their help
               pyramid shows how friction fixers do their work, from reframing
               friction troubles they can't fix right now, so they feel less
               threatening, to designing and repairing organizations. The heart
               of the book digs into the causes and solutions for five of the
               most common and damaging friction troubles: oblivious leaders,
               addition sickness, broken connections, jargon monoxide, and fast
               and frenzied people and teams. Sound familiar? Sutton and Rao are
               here to help. They wrap things up with lessons for leading your
               own friction project, including linking little things to big
               things; the power of civility, caring, and love for propelling
               designs and repairs; and embracing the mess that is an inevitable
               part of the process (while still trying to clean it up).},

                  While the physical world is three-dimensional, most data is
                  trapped on two-dimensional pages and screens. This gulf
                  between the real and digital worlds prevents us from fully
                  exploiting the volumes of information now available to us.
                  Augmented reality, a set of technologies that superimposes
                  digital data and images on physical objects and environments,
                  is closing this gap. By putting information directly into the
                  context in which we’ll apply it, AR increases our ability to
                  absorb and act on it. AR will become the new interface between
                  humans and machines, say Michael E. Porter of Harvard and
                  James E. Heppelmann, the CEO of the industrial software maker
                  PTC. Many people are familiar with AR entertainment
                  applications, such as Snapchat filters, but AR is being
                  applied in far more consequential ways in business. Pioneering
                  organizations are already implementing it in product
                  development, manufacturing, logistics, marketing, service, and
                  training—and are seeing major gains in quality and
                  productivity. AR improves how users visualize information,
                  receive and follow instructions, and interact with products.
                  AccuVein, for instance, uses AR technology that converts the
                  heat signature of a patient’s veins into an image superimposed
                  on the skin, making them much easier to locate. Boeing uses AR
                  to show trainees how to assemble an aircraft wing—and has cut
                  the time it takes them to do that task by 35\%. At GE, factory
                  workers have achieved a similar gain in efficiency by using
                  voice commands in AR experiences to perform complex wiring. AR
                  will have a wide impact on how companies compete. This article
                  walks readers through the questions firms need to ask when
                  integrating it into their strategies and operations. The
                  article also includes HBR’s first embedded AR experiences,
                  which readers can launch by downloading a new HBR app on their

                  Qualifications (NVQs), which, in turn, are still controversial
                  some twenty years after they were first introduced. The paper
                  argues that a competence-based approach can be beneficial to
                  both organisations and individuals, but the ambiguities
                  inherent in the NVQ model of competence create tensions and
                  opportunities for restrictive as well as expansive forms
                  implementation.},

                  particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies
                  that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere
                  along the virtuality continuum" which connects completely real
                  environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best
                  known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all
                  cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is
                  augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The
                  converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore
                  Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display
                  environments are identified. However, an attempt to
                  distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are
                  primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real
                  world is viewed directly or via some electronic display
                  medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the
                  world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the
                  scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto
                  the real world leads to quite different groupings among the
                  six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an
                  efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to
                  which essential differences can be identified. The obvious'
                  distinction between the terms real" and virtual" is shown to
                  have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one
                  is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual
                  images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An
                  (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed,
                  comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge
                  (how much do we know about the world being displayed?"),
                  Reproduction Fidelity (how realistically' are we able to
                  display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor (what is the

               1924 and 1926, is a fundamental text that presciently questioned

                  support thematic analysis using a publicly available interview
                  dataset from Lumivero. It introduces Guided AI Thematic
                  Analysis (GAITA), an adaptation of King et al.’s (2018)
                  Template Analysis. This framework positions researchers as a
                  reflexive instrument and intellectual leader while thoroughly
                  guiding GPT-4 in four stages: data familiarization;
                  preliminary coding; template formation and finalization; and
                  theme development. Additionally, the article proposes the
                  ACTOR framework, a simple approach to combining different
                  effective prompting techniques when working with GenAI for
                  qualitative research purposes. Findings reveal GenAI’s

                  land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an

                  buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.},

               in the field, the book has sold more than a million copies. Now a
               second revolution is under way in the approach to ADD, and the
               news is great. Drug therapies, our understanding of the role of
               diet and exercise, even the way we define the disorder - all are
               changing radically. And doctors are realizing that millions of
               adults suffer from this condition, though the vast majority of
               them remain undiagnosed and untreated. In this new book, Drs
               Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey build on the breakthroughs
               of Driven to Distraction to offer a comprehensive and entirely
               up-to-date guide to living a successful life with ADD. As
               Hallowell and Ratey point out, 'attention deficit disorder' is a
               highly misleading description of an intriguing kind of mind.
               Original, charismatic, energetic, often brilliant, people with
               ADD have extraordinary talents and gifts embedded in their highly
               charged but easily distracted minds. Tailored expressly to ADD
               learning styles and attention spans, Delivered from Distraction
               provides accessible, engaging discussions of every aspect of the
               condition, from diagnosis to finding the proper treatment regime.
               Inside you'll discover: - whether ADD runs in families - new
               diagnostic procedures, tests, and evaluations - the links between
               ADD and other conditions - how people with ADD can free up their
               inner talents and strengths - the new drugs and how they work,
               and why they're not for everyone - exciting advances in
               nonpharmaceutical therapies, including changes in diet, exercise,
               and lifestyle - how to adapt the classic twelve-step program to
               treat ADD - sexual problems associated with ADD and how to
               resolve them - strategies for dealing with procrastination,
               clutter, and chronic forgetfulness ADD is a trait, a way of
               living in the world. It only becomes a disorder when it impairs
               your life. Featuring gripping profiles of patients with ADD who
               have triumphed, Delivered from Distraction is a wise, loving
               guide to releasing the positive energy that all people with ADD
               hold inside. If you have ADD or care about someone who does, this
               is the book you must read.},

               Ratey literally 'wrote the book' on ADD/ADHD more than two
               decades ago. Their bestseller, Driven to Distraction, largely
               introduced this diagnosis to the public and sold more than a
               million copies along the way. Now, most people have heard of ADHD
               and know someone who may have it. But lost in the discussion of
               both childhood and adult diagnosis of ADHD is the potential
               upside: many hugely successful entrepreneurs and highly creative
               people attribute their achievements to ADHD. Also unknown to most
               are the recent research developments, including innovations that
               give a clearer understanding of the ADHD brain in action. In ADHD
               2.0, Drs Hallowell and Ratey, both of whom have this 'variable
               attention trait', draw on the latest science to provide both
               parents and adults with ADHD a plan for minimizing the downside
               and maximizing the benefits of ADHD at any age. They offer an
               arsenal of new strategies and lifestyle hacks for thriving with
               ADHD, including: - Find the right kind of difficult. Use these
               behaviour assessments to discover the work, activity, or creative
               outlet best suited to an individual's unique strengths. -
               Reimagine environment. What specific elements to look for - at
               home, at school, or in the workplace - to enhance the creativity
               and entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the ADHD mind. - Embrace
               innate neurological tendencies. Take advantage of new findings
               about the brain's default mode network and cerebellum, which
               confer major benefits for people with ADHD. - Tap into the

               strategies that have helped her survive, even thrive, in a world
               not built for her brain. “The world of ADHD has been waiting for
               this book with bated breath for many years. If there’s a fairy
               godmother of our lot, it’s Jessica McCabe.”—Edward Hallowell, MD,

               harder.” When your brain works differently, you need to try
               different. Diagnosed with ADHD at age twelve, Jessica struggled
               with a brain that she didn’t understand. She lost things
               constantly, couldn’t finish projects, and felt like she was
               putting more effort in than everyone around her while falling
               further and further behind. At thirty-two years old—broke,
               divorced, and living with her mom—Jessica decided to look more
               deeply into her ADHD challenges. She reached out to experts,
               devoured articles, and shared her discoveries on YouTube. In How
               to ADHD, Jessica reveals the tools that have changed her life
               while offering an unflinching look at the realities of living
               with ADHD. The key to navigating a world not built for the
               neurodivergent brain, she discovered, isn’t to fix or fight
               against its natural tendencies but to understand and work with
               them. She explains how ADHD affects everyday life, covering
               executive function impairments, rejection sensitivity,
               difficulties with attention regulation, and more. You’ll also
               find ADHD-specific strategies for adapting your environment,
               routines, and systems, including: • Boost the signal and decrease
               the noise. Facilitate focus by putting your goals where you can
               see them and fighting distractions with distractions. • Have less
               stuff to manage. Learn why you have trouble planning and
               prioritizing, and why doing more starts with doing less. • Build
               your “time wisdom.” Work backward when you plan, and track how
               long it actually takes you to do something. • Learn about your
               emotions. Understand how naming your emotions and letting
               yourself experience them can make them easier to regulate. With
               quotes from Jessica’s online community, chapter summaries, and
               reading shortcuts designed for the neurodivergent reader, How to
               ADHD will help you recognize your strengths and challenges,

               theory methods shape qualitative interviewing in relation to
               personal narratives and guide analysis of interview data.
               Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible
               strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data
               collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of inductive
               steps that successively lead the researcher from studying
               concrete realities to rendering a conceptual understanding of
               them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney G. Glaser and
               Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop middle-range theories
               from qualitative data. Hence they not only intended to
               conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to demonstrate
               relations between conceptual categories and to specify the
               conditions under which theoretical relationships emerge, change,

  abstract     = {Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to provide practical
                  recommendations for shadowing as a method of organizational
                  study with a focus on the situated processes and practices of
                  shadowing fieldwork. Design/methodology/approach– This paper
                  reflects on the shadowing experiences of three researchers –
                  in a hospital emergency department, nuclear power plants, and
                  entrepreneur workspaces – to generate recommendations by
                  identifying and synthesizing solutions that emerged during the
                  encounters with the challenges and opportunities in shadowing.
                  Findings– Considering shadowing as an ongoing and emergent
                  research process can be helpful to prepare for particular
                  aspects of shadowing fieldwork. Shadowing presents research
                  challenges that may emerge in the practice of fieldwork,
                  including how to negotiate awkward conversations with
                  participants, what to bring and wear, and how to take notes.
                  Practical implications– Though the recommendations for
                  shadowing are based on particular experiences and may not
                  generalize to all shadowing engagements, they offer concrete,
                  practical recommendations useful across experience levels. The
                  recommendations should sensitize researchers to the intimate
                  and situational character of shadowing, and offer strategies
                  for coping with the distinctive requirements of shadowing.
                  Originality/value– By looking across diverse experiences of
                  shadowing, the paper generated guidelines that help to make
                  sense of shadowing processes, manage uncertainty in the field,
                  and build on the emerging work on shadowing. The ten
                  recommendations provide insight into shadowing that are of
                  particular value to graduate students, junior researchers, and
                  those new to shadowing. Moreover, the experienced shadower may
                  find value in the camaraderie of shared experience, the
                  concrete ideas about another's experience of shadowing, and
                  insight in recommendations that capture aspects of fieldwork
                  that they are also exploring.},

               as its key purposes, objects, formation and practices. In short,
               it seeks to outline and elaborate the nature of the project of
               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues
               that the provision of vocational education needs to realise
               important personal and social goals.},

               stop when you leave school or tertiary studies, but continues
               throughout life. The workplace is now seen as an important
               learning environment, and businesses and government units are
               encouraged to become 'learning organisations'. This is all very
               well in theory, but how does learning actually occur in the
               workplace?Drawing on research of a wide variety of workplaces in
               different countries, Stephen Billett analyses the strengths and
               limitations of 'on-the-job' learning. He outlines what knowledge
               individuals need and how they can best acquire this knowledge in
               workplace settings. He shows how to develop a workplace
               curriculum, and how it can be implemented in organisations of
               different sizes. Learning in the Workplace offers a comprehensive
               pedagogy for the workplace. It is a valuable reference for human

               associated with learning processes and an explanation of those
               processes. Much, and probably most, of the learning and
               development across individuals working lives occurs outside of
               circumstances of direct guidance or instruction. Yet, recent
               considerations of individuals’ epistemologies and developments

               explanations about individuals’ contributions to learning at and

               individuals’ processes of learning, both within and outside of
               situations of guidance by more experienced workers, needs to be
               more fully understood, and accepted as being person dependent.

                  the appointment of the Reagan Labor Board in 1983. Empirical

                 research findings - both quantitative and qualitative - and
                 identifies ten key messages: (1) The starting points are to
                 recognise that: (a) paradigms of learning differ; and (b)
                 workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as
                 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include
                 the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of
                 training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards;
                 (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance
                 and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively
                 low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in
                 improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace
                 training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the
                 importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of
                 workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards
                 those at the top of the occupational hierarchy; (7) Much of the
                 qualitative evidence shows that learning occurs naturally in
                 all workplaces as part of everyday activity in line with the
                 learning as participation approach; (8) Workplace learning
                 takes many forms stretching across a 'formal-informal'
                 continuum; (9) International research evidence suggests that
                 the key inter-related determinants in the variability of
                 workplace learning environments are context and individual
                 behaviour; and (10) External recognition and accreditation of
                 workplace learning is problematic due to its largely collective
                 and dynamic nature.},

               nature, distribution and utilization of occupational skills and
               knowledge have always had an impact on VET practice and policy.
               VET research is concerned with exploring continuity as well as
               change. This chapter offers a reflection on how the interplay of
               change and continuity might require a more substantive and
               relational approach across the VET landscape. It questions
               whether VET researchers are sufficiently concerned with the life
               and practices of contemporary workplaces. The chapter tentatively
               suggests that it is time for some recalibration of the way VET
               research is conceived and organized in order to have a broader
               influence on policy and practice at both a national and
               international level. A focus on work might also offer a way to
               overcome some of the difficulties involved in comparative VET

  abstract     = {Purpose– The primary objective in this paper is to examine the
                  role of small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in promoting
                  and/or hindering educational opportunities to adult employees
                  in the UK.Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws on 12
                  case studies of SMEs in England and Scotland, which form part
                  of a larger European Sixth Framework Programme research
                  project. Interviews were conducted with employers, line
                  managers and employees participating in formal educational
                  programmes, and were contextualized with policy documents and
                  literature on lifelong learning and workplace
                  education.Findings– This paper highlights and explores
                  findings related to human resource management (HRM) and the
                  participation of employees in formal education, and the
                  experiences of companies in providing educational
                  opportunities to employees in England and Scotland. The paper
                  argues that employers have a key role to play in driving and
                  investing in employee training and development. However, the
                  current focus of employers on formal educational opportunities
                  appears narrowly focused on job‐specific, in‐house
                  training.Originality/value– The paper's value lies in its
                  illustration of the restricted focus of the lifelong learning
                  policy agenda on the development of human capital, which not
                  only limits the development of portable skills and
                  qualifications for employees, but also undermines the broader
                  aims of lifelong learning.},

                  learning (WIL) has expanded considerably. While early research
                  predominantly utilized quantitative study designs, recently a
                  more diverse set of methodologies is being used to address
                  questions and issues arising from a range of WIL models. This
                  Special Issue is intended to present different methodologies
                  available to WIL researchers. The papers include case studies
                  of how these methodologies, and methods within, are being used
                  for WIL research, along with discussion of the strengths and
                  limitations of using the research approach. Examples of case
                  study methodology, multiple case studies, mixed methods,

                  particular contexts making it highly suited to flexible,
                  multiple perspective methodologies, such as case study.
                  However, case study methodology is often criticized for being
                  too specific, not generalizable and limited in what it can
                  contribute to theory. In addition, there is often confusion
                  between the meaning and application of the terms method and
                  methodology. This paper presents an argument to help guide and
                  support researchers who are considering a case study approach
                  to their WIL research. Two vignettes demonstrate how
                  researchers overcame some of the alleged limitations of case

  abstract     = {[John Dewey and L. S. Vygotsky share similar ideas concerning
                  the relationship of activity and learning/development,
                  especially the roles everyday activities and social
                  environment play in the educational process. However, the two
                  theorists are far apart in their conception of the
                  relationship between process and goals in education. Dewey
                  concentrates on means in education, believing that it is the
                  ability of the individual to question through experience that
                  is most important for the human community. Vygotsky, while
                  recognizing the importance of (especially cultural) process in
                  education, sees social and cultural goals as being integrated
                  into social pedagogy. This paper compares Dewey and Vygotsky
                  on three key points that relate directly to educational
                  processes and goals. First, the two theorists are compared on
                  the role of social history and the tools it produces. Dewey
                  sees social history as creating a set of malleable tools that
                  are of use in present circumstances. Vygotsky believes that
                  tools developed through history have a far more lasting impact
                  on the social community. Second, the two theorists are
                  compared in their conceptualizations of experience/culture.
                  Dewey sees experience as helping to form thinking, whereas
                  Vygotsky, in his cultural historical theory, posits culture as
                  the raw material of thinking. Third, the two theorists are
                  compared on their perspectives on human inquiry. Dewey sees
                  the child as a free agent who achieves goals through her own
                  interest in the activity. Vygotsky suggests there should be
                  greater control by a mentor who creates activity that will
                  lead the child towards mastery. These differences are then
                  explored in terms of how they might impact actual classroom
                  strategies and curriculum.]},

               builds on the success of a number of initiatives, including
               formative findings from literature, research and development and
               practice-based evidence (success stories). It presents new
               thinking and direction from leading experts in the fields of:
               design, process, construction, engineering, manufacturing,
               logistics, robotics, delivery platforms, business and
               transformational strategies, change management, legislation,
               organisational learning, software design, innovation and
               biomimetics. This book is particularly novel and timely, as it
               brings together a number of cogent subjects under one collective
               ‘umbrella’. Each of these chapters contain original findings, all
               of which culminate in three 'Key Learning Points' which provide
               new insight into the cross-cutting themes, interrelationships and
               symbiotic forces that exist between each of these chapters. This
               approach also provides readers with new contextualised
               understanding of the wider issues affecting the offsite market,
               from the need to embrace societal challenges, through to the
               development of rich value-laden solutions required for creating

                 practice of the decoupling of apprenticeship from the concept

                 economy, and addressed the following research questions: How is
                 the concept of occupation and occupational identity defined and

  abstract  = {In tandem with the diffusion of computer technologies, labour
               markets across the OECD have undergone rapid structural
               transformation. In this paper, we examine i) the impact of
               technological change on labour market outcomes since the computer
               revolution of the 1980s, and ii) recent developments in digital
               technology – including machine learning and robotics – and their
               potential impacts on the future of work. While it is evident that
               the composition of the workforce has shifted dramatically over
               recent decades, in part as a result of technological change, the
               impacts of digitalisation on the future of jobs are far from
               certain. On the one hand, accumulating anecdotal evidence shows
               that the potential scope of automation has expanded beyond
               routine work, making technological change potentially
               increasingly labour-saving: according to recent estimates 47
               percent of US jobs are susceptible to automation over the
               forthcoming decades. On the other hand, there is evidence
               suggesting that digital technologies have not created many new
               jobs to replace old ones: an upper bound estimate is that around
               0.5 percent of the US workforce is employed in digital industries
               that emerged throughout the 2000s. Nevertheless, at first
               approximation, there is no evidence to suggest that the computer
               revolution so far has reduced overall demand for jobs as
               technologically stagnant sectors of the economy – including
               health care, government and personal services – continue to
               create vast employment opportunities. Looking forward, however,
               we argue that as the potential scope of automation is expanding,
               many sectors that have been technologically stagnant in the past
               are likely to become technologically progressive in the future.
               While we should expect a future surge in productivity as a
               result, the question of whether gains from increases in
               productivity will be widely shared depends on policy responses.},

               introduces the people and systems that will replace them. In an
               internet-enhanced society, according to Richard Susskind and
               Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers,
               accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and
               many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future
               of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies
               - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the
               'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips
               of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face
               interaction. The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the
               arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's
               professionals. They argue that our current professions are
               antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the
               expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place,
               they propose five new models for producing and distributing
               expertise in society. The book raises profound policy issues, not
               least about employment (they envisage a new generation of
               'open-collared workers') and about control over online expertise
               (they warn of new 'gatekeepers') - in an era when machines become
               more capable than human beings at most tasks. With a new preface
               exploring recent critical developments, this updated edition
               builds on the authors' groundbreaking research into more than a
               dozen professions. Illustrated with numerous examples from each,
               this is the first book to assess and question the relevance of
               the professions in the 21st century.},

               of skills has changed in recent years with shifts in the balance
               of power between capital and labour and how the new social
               construction of skills affects different types of workers by sex,
               class, and race, variously helping and hindering the employment
               prospects of these workers. It is argued that the social
               construction of skill constitutes the principal and growing
               portion of employment discrimination today.},

                 citizens for personal fulfilment, a healthy and sustainable
                 lifestyle, employability, active citizenship and social
                 inclusion. The recommendation is a reference tool for education
                 and training stakeholders. It sets up a common understanding of
                 competences needed nowadays and in the future. The reference
                 framework presents successful ways to promote competence
                 development through innovative learning approaches, assessment
                 methods or support to educational staff. All learners should
                 achieve their full potential. To fulfil their different needs,
                 the recommendation encourages Member States to: provide quality
                 early childhood education and care, improve school education
                 and ensure excellent teaching, further develop initial and

               professional work environment demands a focus on aspects of
               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy
               profession which aims, amongst other things, to assist in the
               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,
               into something more ‘integrative’. We believe a focus on context,
               power and perspective, within an understanding of the
               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process
               of change management within education and training. We offer an
               analysis of our template for change within education and training
               in the accountancy profession framed within a discussion of those

               individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far superior
               to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors are
               ‘intelligent tutors’ because they are able to continously adapt
               the content and style of their instruction to best meet the needs
               of the learner. The historical evolution of intelligent tutoring
               systems is presented. The starting point was programmed
               instruction in the late 1960s, followed by knowledge-based tutors
               that try to simulate good human tutors by the integrated use of
               domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and knowledge about the
               individual student. Finally some important current trends like
               distance learning, collaborative learning, and Web-based learning
               are outlined. The presentation is given within a cognitive
               science point of view. From this perspective the research on

               myth-busting guide to AI past and present, one of the world's
               leading researchers shows why our fears for the future are
               misplaced.The ultimate dream of AI is to build machines that are
               like us: conscious and self-aware. While this remains a remote
               possibility, rapid progress in AI is already transforming our

               prospects, from sentient machines to dystopian robot takeovers.In
               this lively and clear-headed guide, Michael Wooldridge challenges
               the prevailing narrative, revealing how the hype distracts us
               from both the more immediate risks that this technology poses -
               from algorithmic bias to fake news - and the true life-changing

               research as a systematic process, describes how to formulate

               research methods (qualitative, quantitative, and experimental),
               and explains how to select appropriate research methods and
               execute research studies. It describes the process of
               documentation, knowledge dissemination, and application of
               research results in architectural design and practice. Most
               importantly, it provides guidelines for integrating research into

               examples to illustrate main concepts, procedures, and
               applications. Integrating research into practice is essential for
               developing new knowledge, solving design and technical problems,
               overcoming different types of challenges present in the
               contemporary profession, and improving the design outcomes.
               Innovation requires a much stronger correlation between research
               and design, and it is pertinent for the future of architectural
               practice that research becomes an integral part of architectural
               profession. This book provides a roadmap for successfully
               integrating research into architectural design and for
               establishing innovative practices, regardless of a firm’s size.

                  factors, we can gain greater insight into the phenomenon of
                  why organisations adopt different practices and why they
                  create such different learning environments. The article draws
                  on emerging findings from an ESRC?funded multisector study in
                  the UK and uses illustrations from two contrasting sectors to
                  highlight the impact of context on pedagogical practice.},

                  capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and
                  the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the
                  nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the
                  ?epistemology of possession,? since it treats knowledge as
                  something people possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot
                  account for the knowing found in individual and group
                  practice. Knowing as action calls for an ?epistemology of
                  practice.? Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to
                  privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge
                  possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups.
                  Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging
                  and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right.
                  Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit,
                  individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct
                  and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others
                  cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually
                  enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of
                  knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the
                  social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge
                  and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of
                  knowing. We believe this generative dance between knowledge
                  and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation.
                  Harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and
                  technological infrastructures that support the interplay of
                  knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these concepts make
                  possible a more robust framing of such
                  epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the
                  management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these
                  views through three brief case studies drawn from recent
                  research.},

               sector results in part from little product or service innovation
               that can create value for the industry. This chapter provides a
               thick description of business innovation typologies relating to
               the offsite construction industry in the US. Offsite construction
               is ‘the process of planning, designing, fabricating,
               transporting, and assembling building elements for rapid site
               assembly to a greater degree of finish than in traditional
               piecemeal on-site construction’. Legislatively, however, the
               process was more clearly regulated and streamlined, occurring
               primarily offsite, which helps explain why one in every ten
               housing units constructed each year today in the US are
               manufactured homes. The US economy presents new opportunities for
               permanent modular construction to compete. Disruptive, sustaining
               and radical innovation have all been proffered as potential
               solutions to answer the construction sector’s stagnation in

  abstract  = {The three concepts central to this volume—practice, learning and
               change—have received very different treatments in the educational
               literature, an oversight directly confronted here. While learning
               and change have been extensively theorised, their various
               contexts articulated and analysed, practice is notably
               underrepresented. Where much of the literature on learning and
               change takes the notion of ‘practice’ as an unexamined given, its
               co-location as a term with various classifiers, as in ‘legal
               practice’ and ‘teaching practice’, render it curiously devoid of
               semantic force.In this book, ‘practice’ is the super-ordinate
               organising idea. Drawing on what has been termed the ‘practice
               turn in contemporary theory’, the work develops a conceptual
               framework for researching learning in, and on, practice. It
               challenges received notions of practice, questioning the
               assumptions, elisions, conflations and silences on the subject.
               In so doing, it offers fresh insights into learning and change,
               and how they relate to practice. In tandem with this conceptual
               work, the book details site-ontological studies of practice and
               learning in diverse professional and workplace contexts,
               examining the work of occupations as various as doctors, chefs
               and orchestral musicians. It demonstrates the value of theorising
               practice, learning and change, as well as exploring the
               connections between them amid our evolving social and
               institutional structures.},

  abstract  = {This book centres on a broadened view of complexity that will
               enrich engagement with complexity in the social sciences. The key
               idea is to employ complexity theory to develop a holistic account
               of practice, agency and expertise. In doing so, the book
               acknowledges and builds upon the relational character of
               reductive accounts. It draws upon recent theoretical work on
               complexity, emergence and relationality to develop a novel
               account of practice, agency and expertise in and for workplaces.
               Biological, psychological and social aspects of these are
               integrated. This novel account overcomes problems in current
               views of practice, agency and expertise, which suffer from
               reductive, or fragmented, analyses, based upon individuals,
               groups, or networks. In retrieving the experiential richness of
               human activity – often esteemed as the basis of generative and
               creative life – this book shows how complexity both emerges from,
               and is, a non-reductive feature of, human experience, especially
               in daily work.“...an ambitiously wide-ranging volume, questioning
               the key tenets of respected approaches ..... and offering .....
               ‘novel accounts’, which draw on features of complexity
               thinking.... ...But they go further than any of us in their
               argument that: ‘whatever reductive moves are made, they ‘flow’
               from holistic accounts of relationality which have already
               affectively engaged the purposes of a co-present group.’ This is
               the intellectual contribution that is built consistently and
               persuasively across the chapters.” Professor Emerita Anne
               Edwards, Oxford University"Hager and Beckett have written a book
               that will challenge more commonly held notions of agency,
               practice, skills, and learning. Centering their argument on
               complexity theory or, as they prefer, complexity thinking, Hager
               and Beckett argue that it is through relations that we raise
               questions about, gather data from, and make working sense of the
               complexity that surrounds us. Groups then, particularly small
               groups, hold and implement agentive power. And what the authors
               call co-present groups—ones in which holistic relationality
               occurs socially, and affectively in distinctive places—“draw us
               closer to each other, and harness our normativity by enabling
               negotiability and reason-giving.” If your field of study involves
               anything remotely sociocultural in nature or if you are just
               interested in the complex ways we engage as humans with our
               worlds, you should find a place for this book in your

                  aspect of youth work practice, in the main it is dominated by
                  a simplistic four stage cycle which is attributed to Kolb
                  (1984). However, it will be demonstrated in this article that
                  this is a misinterpretation of Kolb's theory which results in
                  a limited view of 'experience' within experiential learning.
                  It is argued that not only a deeper understanding of Kolb's
                  original theory is required, but a return must be made to John
                  Dewey, perhaps the architect of experiential learning, to
                  fully comprehend its importance. In so doing, a fuller
                  appreciation of young people's experience is acquired, as well
                  as a wider theoretical basis established for existing youth

  abstract  = {The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been
               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.},

  abstract  = {Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an
               international readership of undergraduate and postgraduate

               professionals, policy-makers, and researchers.},

  abstract     = {Purpose: The present study seeks to examine the efficacy of
                  different training modalities on increasing workplace
                  learning, representatives' intent to transfer what they
                  learned into their work, and importantly how training impacts
                  actual work performance. These relationships are tested in the
                  context of a Chinese division of a multinational
                  pharmaceutical company, where pharmaceutical representatives
                  are tasked with relaying relevant efficacy and safety
                  information on pharmaceutical products to health care
                  professionals who prescribe them to patients. Methods: The
                  present study employed a three-group between-subjects
                  experimental design. Representatives received varying forms of
                  training (instruction only, instruction plus reflection, and
                  instruction, reflection, plus direct feedback) based on
                  experimental conditions. After three training sessions over
                  the course of six weeks, representatives were assessed on how
                  much they learned in the training and their actual work
                  performance through observer assessment of meetings with
                  health care professionals, facilitated by the representatives.
                  Findings: In this study, it was found that the process of
                  actively reflecting on what was learned in training led to
                  increased learning, as well as increased performance, compared
                  to simply studying the material. However, receiving direct
                  feedback on training performance, combined with active
                  reflection training, did not provide any further benefits in
                  terms of learning or work performance. Notably, there were no
                  differences in intent to transfer learned material to work, as
                  all conditions reported high levels of transfer intention.
                  Conclusion: The finding provides insightful evidence to
                  support the benefits of fostering trainees' active reflections
                  for work-based learning in the Chinese industry training
                  scenario. In contrast, receiving direct comments on how
                  students performed from a manager or trainer, as well as
                  advise on how do better in the future, had no effect on
                  increasing learning or performance. Although the effect of
                  direct feedback is not statistically significant in this
                  context, further research should be done in understanding
                  individuals' thoughts and behaviors when received direct
                  feedbacks received in workplace training. Relatively little
                  workplace research has assessed both workplace learning and
                  performance in the same study, specifically in the Chinese
                  context. While training efficacy likely varies across cultures
                  to begin with, compensation structures in China do not provide
                  the same monetary incentives for workplace learning (i.e.
                  chance to increase income) as Western culture. This means that

  abstract  = {Summary What is typical of a vocational curriculum is that it is
               a course of learning across different school- and work-based
               practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
               boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
               boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
               discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
               between school and work practices have frequently been reported
               as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
               individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
               relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
               chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential of
               boundary crossing between school and work practices, which we
               summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms: identification,
               coordination, perspective making and taking (or mutual
               reflection), and transformation. These learning mechanisms are
               discussed through illustrations from vocational education and
               training. The chapter concludes by speculating on what would be
               fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a vocational
               curriculum could be improved.},

               at the identification of personal and/or situational factors that
               contribute to PhD candidates’ attrition and persistence,
               respectively. By doing so, the literature has adopted a rather
               passive perspective towards PhD candidates and their development.
               The active role of candidates being agentic constructors of their
               academic career has been widely neglected. This study therefore
               focuses on how PhD students can take an active approach towards
               their academic development. A qualitative interview study with
               ten German faculty members was conducted to answer the following
               research questions: (1) How do supervisors conceptualise academic
               success of PhD students? (2) How does professional agency affect
               academic success of young researchers? (3) What individual and/or
               contextual factors affect the exercise of professional agency?
               Based on these interviews, evidence is reported on how doctoral
               candidates can indeed affect their academic development and
               eventually their success by exercising professional agency. Among
               others, the study participants mentioned proactive networking,
               negotiation of external demands and deliberate information and

  abstract     = {Purpose Industry 4.0 is assumed to yield extensive
                  industry-spanning opportunities. However, exploiting these
                  opportunities requires a targeted implementation of Industry
                  4.0. The purpose of this paper is to generate a deeper
                  understanding of relevant implementation action. Existing
                  recommendations are mostly general, highly aggregated and
                  difficult to grasp. Yet, specific and concrete actions that
                  need to be taken to accelerate the realization of Industry 4.0
                  are essential.Design/methodology/approach The article uses 13
                  semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the source of
                  empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers
                  from Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies.
                  All interviews are analyzed using qualitative content
                  analysis.Findings The study reveals relevant and targeted
                  aspects for Industry 4.0 implementation: the development of
                  Industry 4.0-specific know-how, securing financial resources,
                  integrating employees into the implementation process and
                  establishing an open-minded and flexible corporate culture.
                  Further aspects include comprehensive planning processes,
                  cooperation with external partners, proper handling of data
                  interfaces, interdisciplinary communication, an adaptable
                  organizational structure and data security.Research
                  limitations/implications The paper is limited to German
                  manufacturing enterprises and should be transferred to other
                  industries and countries.Practical implications The study
                  supports managers to effectively implement Industry 4.0 within
                  their organizations and consequently benefit from Industry 4.0
                  and derives recommendations for future
                  research.Originality/value The paper is among the first to
                  give specific and concrete examples for lessons learned from
                  Industry 4.0 implementation, directly obtained from industrial
                  application.},

                 projects requires a clear understanding of how the stages and
                 players involved interrelate. From the inception of the project
                 onwards, information is generated which is then required to be
                 adapted and communicated through the various stages to the
                 individuals involved so as to complete the project. Of these
                 stages, the design has always been recognised as important but,
                 in project management terms, not easily managed. The activities
                 involved in designing are complex and there is a need to employ
                 the services of an increasing number of specialists. This
                 research uses the framework developed in Business Process
                 Re-engineering (BPR) to establish the existing process involved
                 in developing and managing the design. An important element of
                 the building, the façade, is used as an example of what happens
                 more generally and the research is based on an in-depth case
                 study approach of four UK construction projects. To deal with
                 the quantity and quality of the qualitative data, the
                 methodology of cognitive mapping is used to first create, and
                 then analyse, the perceptions of key decision makers involved
                 in the creation and management of the design. Using computer
                 based analytical tools the data is filtered through a number of
                 stages to produce summaries of the process of design. The
                 results of the research identify the need for the communication
                 of the key project objectives, together with the formation of a
                 strategy for achieving these objectives, at the outset.
                 Selection of the right individuals, at the right time will
                 significantly increase the development of the team approach,
                 which is necessary to successfully develop the design. Finally,
                 the use of formalised reviews can ensure that design progresses
                 so as to meet the project objectives.},

               intelligence. Writing with clarity and passion, leading AI
               researcher Melanie Mitchell offers a captivating account of
               modern-day artificial intelligence. Flavoured with personal
               stories and a twist of humour, Artificial Intelligence
               illuminates the workings of machines that mimic human learning,
               perception, language, creativity and common sense. Weaving
               together advances in AI with cognitive science and philosophy,
               Mitchell probes the extent to which today's 'smart' machines can
               actually think or understand, and whether AI even requires such
               elusive human qualities at all.Artificial Intelligence: A Guide
               for Thinking Humans provides readers with an accessible and
               clear-eyed view of the AI landscape, what the field has actually
               accomplished, how much further it has to go and what it means for
               all of our futures.},

  abstract     = {In construction, the mirroring of knowledge with tasks
                  increasingly limits firm-level abilities to identify and
                  pursue systemic innovation opportunities. Recent research
                  identifies how integration strategies enable individual
                  projects to break from this trap, but much less is known about
                  potential strategic action of firms to enable systemic
                  innovation. To explore this, a longitudinal comparative case
                  study examines how three entrepreneurial firms ? DPR
                  construction, RAD Urban, and Project Frog ? in the San
                  Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic evolution and
                  restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five years to
                  enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each firm
                  has developed a different approach ? relational, project-based
                  spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems integration.
                  Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The
                  approaches are theorized as a form of strategic
                  mirror-breaking intended to redefine the current paradigm of
                  knowledge and task dependencies. They enable the firms to
                  develop products with new system architectures and access more
                  opportunities for innovation in digitally-enabled
                  manufacturing. The paper concludes with discussion of how the
                  identification and characterization of strategies for
                  mirror-breaking enriches understanding of integration for
                  systemic innovation in construction at the firm level. The
                  paper identifies common themes for digitally-enabled
                  manufacturing including the limitations of the current
                  industry structure, the emergence of new hybrid positions, and
                  the opportunity for platforms to provide longitudinal
                  integration.},

                 sector has had a material effect on secular productivity growth
                 for the economy as a whole. Prior work has focused on the role
                 of potential measurement problems in construction, particularly
                 output deflators in the measurement of productivity. This paper
                 brings some new evidence to bear on the industry’s measured
                 productivity problems and suggests that measurement error is
                 probably not the sole source of the stagnation. First, using
                 measures of physical productivity in housing construction,
                 productivity is falling or, at best, stagnant over multiple
                 decades. Second, there has been a noticeable decline over time
                 in the efficiency with which construction firms translate
                 materials inputs into output, and a corresponding shift toward
                 more value-added-intensive production. Third, using state-level
                 data, we do not find evidence of patterns of within-industry
                 reallocation that might be expected of efficiently operating
                 input and output markets. States with more productive
                 construction sectors do not see growth in their shares of total
                 U.S. construction activity; if anything, their shares fall.

               new interpretation of why technology has all too often benefited
               elites - and how we must reshape the path of innovation to create
               true shared prosperity.A thousand years of history and
               contemporary evidence make one thing clear. Progress is not
               automatic but depends on the choices we make about technology.
               New ways of organizing production and communication can either
               serve the narrow interests of an elite or become the foundation
               for widespread prosperity.Much of the wealth generated by
               agricultural advances during the European Middle Ages was
               captured by the Church and used to build grand cathedrals while
               the peasants starved. The first hundred years of
               industrialization in England delivered stagnant incomes for
               workers, while making a few people very rich. And throughout the
               world today, digital technologies and artificial intelligence
               increase inequality and undermine democracy through excessive
               automation, massive data collection, and intrusive
               surveillance.It doesn't have to be this way. Power and Progress
               demonstrates that the path of technology was once - and can again
               be - brought under control. The tremendous computing advances of
               the last half century can become empowering and democratizing
               tools, but not if all major decisions remain in the hands of a
               few hubristic tech leaders striving to build a society that
               elevates their own power and prestige.With their breakthrough
               economic theory and manifesto for a better society, Acemoglu and
               Johnson provide the understanding and the vision to reshape how
               we innovate and who really gains from technological advances so
               we can create real prosperity for all.},

                  probable futures, and evaluating, negotiating and giving form
                  to preferred ones. Practices of making futures are
                  increasingly online. Yet, as organizational participants come
                  together online ? organizing remotely to make offline futures
                  ? they lack the shared experiential knowledge that is gained
                  through embodied and situated practices. In this essay, we
                  argue that the lack of experiential knowledge makes future
                  making online difficult to organize and vulnerable to
                  excluding relevant expertise; dialogue may become
                  inward-looking and self-referential within the online
                  environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the
                  futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on
                  the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to
                  articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to
                  suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as
                  a form of inquiry ? as a distributed and reflective process
                  that proceeds through engagement with representations of the
                  future ? we identify three remedial actions for online future
                  making: to solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change
                  medium. These remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack
                  of shared experiential knowledge by both sustaining the online
                  involvement of heterogeneous remote participants and by
                  bringing in relevant (offline) places, people and materials to
                  online future making.},

               child bored in class, the disillusioned employee and those of us
               who feel frustrated but can't quite explain why - and shows how
               we all need to reach our Element. Through the stories of people
               like Vidal Sassoon, Arianna Huffington and Matt Groening, who
               have recognized their unique talents and made a successful living
               doing what they love, Robinson explains how every one of us can
               find ourselves in our Element, and achieve everything we're
               capable of. With a wry sense of humour, Ken Robinson shows the
               urgent need to enhance creativity and innovation by thinking
               differently about ourselves. Above all, he inspires us to
               reconnect with our true self - it could just change everything.

  abstract     = {Firms modularize as they move into industrialized
                  construction. Prior research highlights the importance of
                  their modularization strategies, arguing that firms can either
                  build the competence for modularization internally or can
                  source them externally. To understand what shapes a firm?s
                  choice to use external competences in its modularization
                  strategy, we studied three leading construction firms. In this
                  multiple case study, Alpha, Beta and Gamma are leaders in
                  Asian markets, using reinforced concrete solutions in
                  high-rise industrialized construction. Where external
                  competences are available, our analyses show the work firms do
                  to make them reliable and that their choice to use external
                  competences is shaped by their reliability. Alpha modularized
                  in a context with little available external competences, so it
                  built new competences in-house; Beta chose to use the
                  externally available manufacturing and assembly competences,
                  using standards, remote monitoring and control of product
                  architectures to make them reliable for their use in
                  modularization; Gamma had available competences in the
                  external context and initially sought to use them, but
                  reliability concerns led to it modularizing by acquiring the
                  firms to bring these competences in-house. Our contribution is
                  to show how ensuring the reliability of external competences
                  shapes modularization strategies. Further, we have identified
                  actions that firms can adopt to make external competences
                  reliable through: (1) use of international standards, (2)
                  quality control procedures, (3) control of product
                  architectures, and 4) acquisition of external competences. We
                  provide implications for practitioners and policy makers
                  seeking to transition to industrialized construction; and
                  discuss new areas for research.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Human one-to-one tutoring has been shown to be a very
                  effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
                  tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
                  one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of
                  tutoring. To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only
                  on the effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
                  effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as
                  well as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is
                  further tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of
                  tutoring tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to
                  promote a more interactive style of dialogue, rather than a
                  didactic style, tutors were suppressed from giving
                  explanations and feedback. Instead, tutors were encouraged to
                  prompt the students. Surprisingly, students learned just as
                  effectively even when tutors were suppressed from giving
                  explanations and feedback. Their learning in the interactive
                  style of tutoring is attributed to construction from deeper
                  and a greater amount of scaffolding episodes, as well as their
                  greater effort to take control of their own learning by
                  reading more. What they learned from reading was limited,

               made A Short History of Nearly Everything one of the most lauded
               books of the last decade, and delivers one of the most
               entertaining and illuminating books ever written about the
               history of the way we live. Bill Bryson was struck one day by the
               thought that we devote a lot more time to studying the battles
               and wars of history than to considering what history really
               consists of: centuries of people quietly going about their daily
               business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more
               comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind
               can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we
               live.This inspired him to start a journey around his own house,
               an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room
               considering how the ordinary things in life came to be. Along the
               way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of
               anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from
               food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the
               Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant,
               creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered
               that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as
               our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest
               and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the
               corners of every home.},

               to determine behavioral differences among continuous skill
               improving experiences. The experimental results indicate that
               some features, such as task execution time and user head
               movements, are good indexes for skill level and provide valuable
               information that can be applied to obtain an effective task
               model. Operators with varying knowledge and operating habits

                  experiences for military tasks through desktop applications
                  (e.g., games including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic).
                  However, these game-based desktop tutors have also been
                  limited to adaptive instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g.,
                  problem solving and decision-making). The military requires
                  adaptive instruction to extend beyond the desktop to be
                  compatible with the physical nature of many tasks performed by
                  soldiers, sailors, and airmen. This article examines how
                  commercial sensor technologies might be adapted to work with
                  GIFT and support tailored computer-guided instruction in the
                  psychomotor domain for a military medical training task,
                  specifically hemorrhage control. Toward this goal, we
                  evaluated the usability and system features of commercial
                  smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies. Smart glasses
                  were selected as the focus of this study over handheld mobile
                  devices in order to promote a hands-free experience during the
                  training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a mannequin. Pressure
                  sensors were selected to provide direct measures of
                  effectiveness during the application of tourniquets and
                  pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses and
                  pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each
                  other, but with respect to their capabilities to support
                  adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner?s
                  point-of-need and criteria based on established usability
                  heuristics. Instruction in the wild is training provided in an
                  environment outside the classroom and areas where tracking and
                  sensing infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed areas of
                  operation). We examined a wide range of features and
                  capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
                  hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question:
                  what system design features (e.g., usability and interaction)
                  are needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual
                  psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no
                  formal training infrastructure is available?},

  abstract     = {The construction industry is one of the sectors with the
                  highest accident rates. To prevent accidents, construction
                  workers receive occupational safety training and safety
                  instructions. However, experience-based learning of dangerous
                  situations is hardly possible or justifiable in reality.
                  Virtual reality (VR) simulations can be a potential solution
                  in this regard by allowing workers to experience dangerous
                  situations in a very vivid but safe way without being exposed
                  to real hazards. In this study, a VR simulation for
                  construction safety training was developed and tested with
                  trainees that learn the safe operation of hand-operated power
                  tools. In this particular case study, the objective for the
                  participants in the VR simulation was to successfully consider
                  all safety aspects in the operation of an angle grinder. The
                  usability, user experience and implicit learning were
                  investigated during the study. Additionally, we conducted
                  post-play interviews with participants. Results found learning
                  effects of participants as well as a satisfying user
                  experience and usability. The results also show that
                  participants might learn content as presented, risking the
                  learning of false information if the simulation does not cover
                  relevant safety aspects.},

                  interactive methods to communicate with students. New
                  technologies have found their way into classrooms and have
                  proven to be more effective in delivering learning materials
                  to students. Video games have been introduced as one of the
                  possible new tools for educating the upcoming generation in
                  many different fields. Specifically, construction management
                  education has attempted to use simulation software to
                  introduce students to various construction concepts. However,
                  these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to the
                  fun factor which has affected the uptake and therefore the
                  educational impact of such tools. CONVEX is an educational
                  video game that was developed with the objective of teaching
                  high-level construction management concepts without
                  sacrificing enjoyment. A study was conducted that showed that

                  needed to enhance the construction management educational
                  experience. One of these new methods is showing real time
                  videos that highlight the various elements of concern in the
                  classroom lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use
                  augmented reality technology (ART) and a layer of artificial
                  visualizations to simulate the environmental context and
                  spatio-temporal constraints of various construction processes.
                  The superimposition of images serves as an instructional
                  mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into
                  classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints
                  enables learners to visualize context and hidden processes
                  otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom lectures.
                  Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved
                  perception of reality is created through the combination of
                  the learners’ ability to understand the complexity of
                  construction products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite
                  processes by viewing the real environment augmented with
                  computer-generated information layers. Findings Testing the
                  ART video in a classroom with undergraduate construction
                  management students showed that students who were exposed to
                  the ART video were able to remember and identify the
                  highlighted elements in the corresponding assembly more
                  effectively than those who were not. Originality/value ART is
                  a valuable tool in enhancing classroom learning and gives
                  educators a teaching advantage when they combine traditional
                  classroom lectures with ART enabled media.},

               choice of educational activities. Such theories can assist

  abstract     = {This paper traces the origins of the scaffolding construct,
                  placing it in its theoretical-historical context. The paper
                  discusses the connection between Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal
                  Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and
                  explicates the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds.
                  The paper then presents a discussion of the changes that the
                  notion of scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes
                  to supporting students in classroom contexts. In classrooms
                  where one teacher supports multiple students, scaffolding is
                  distributed across various tools and social scaffolds. A
                  discussion of the notion of distributed scaffolding is
                  presented, to describe how students in classrooms may be
                  supported by various tools and social scaffolds. The paper
                  then introduces the kinds of distribution and interactions
                  between tools and social scaffolds that need to be considered
                  to support multiple students in classroom contexts. Finally,
                  distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to the key
                  features of scaffolding, especially fading and transfer of

               of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest form is
               perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The great
               philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that the
               possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: “A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.” A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: “he could [in any case] not be as strong as a mule.”
               Moral perfection is the third, “the highest degree of excellency
               in man’s character.” Of this perfection Maimonides says: “Imagine
               a person being alone, and having no connection whatever with any
               other person; all his good moral principles are at rest, they are
               not required and give man no perfection whatever. These
               principles are only necessary and useful when man comes in
               contact with others.” “The fourth kind of perfection is the true
               perfection of man; the possession of the highest intellectual
               faculties . . . .” In justification of his assertion, this
               extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges: “Examine the
               first three kinds of perfection; you will find that if you
               possess them, they are not your property, but the property of
               others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is exclusively
               yours; no one else owns any part of it.”},

  abstract     = {Purpose This paper aims to compare the performance of building
                  trades apprenticeship programs in the USA, sponsored jointly
                  by employers and unions, with those sponsored unilaterally by
                  employers. It reviews enrolment and graduation rates,
                  including participation of women and minorities. The article
                  also looks behind the numbers to examine the operation of
                  apprenticeship. It reviews the evolution of joint programs,
                  including institutional arrangements and recent innovations to
                  cope with the challenging characteristics of construction
                  labor markets. Design/methodology/approach Statistical
                  comparisons by type of program sponsor are carried out using
                  individual‐level data on registered apprenticeship for the
                  period 1996‐2003. Evolution of apprenticeship programs is
                  discussed in a historical perspective. Findings Joint programs
                  (with union participation) were found to have much higher
                  enrolments and greater participation of women and
                  ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit markedly
                  better performance for all groups on rates of attrition and
                  completion. Joint programs have developed various innovations,
                  including college credit for training and scholarship loans to
                  expand apprenticeship and improve quality and retention,
                  although there are no quantitative evaluations of the
                  effectiveness of many of these specific measures. Research
                  limitations/implications Statistical information includes
                  about 65 percent of all registered apprentices in the USA.
                  Practical implications The paper shows that alternative forms
                  of training sponsorship have substantially different effects
                  on enrolment and graduation. Identification of the practices,
                  that improve enrolment and retention, and their widespread
                  adoption would enhance the effectiveness of training programs.
                  Originality/value The dataset used in this paper has not yet
                  been used in any publications. The findings regarding joint
                  programs are notable, in view of the skilled labor shortages
                  facing the construction industry in the USA.},

                  Novice learning is also framed by the feelings novices
                  experience in the context of practice. Expert learning, on the

                  networks trained with a backpropagation algorithm by which

                  To prevent networks from overfitting and improve their
                  generalization, early stopping and Bayesian regularization are
                  implemented and compared. The results proved a better

                  stopping. To demonstrate the prediction performance of the
                  presented models, the developed models are implemented at two

                  Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development could be used to
                  inform the design of an Interactive Learning Environment
                  called the Ecolab. Two aspects of this work have subsequently
                  been used for further research. Firstly, there is the
                  interpretation of the ZPD and its associated theory that was
                  used to operationalize the ZPD so that it could be implemented
                  in software. This interpretation has informed further research
                  about how one can model context and its impact on learning,
                  which has produced a design framework that has been
                  successfully applied across a range of educational settings.
                  Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The software
                  has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
                  supported explorations into how to scaffold learners’
                  metacognition, how to scaffold learners’ motivation and the
                  implications of a learner’s goal orientation upon their use of
                  the software. The findings from these studies have informed
                  our understanding of learner scaffolding and have produced
                  consistent results to demonstrate the importance of providing
                  learners with appropriately challenging tasks and flexible
                  support. Vygotsky’s work is as relevant now as it was in 1999:
                  it still has an important role to play in the development of
                  educational software.},

                  informal, and workplace education. Highly interdisciplinary,
                  it builds on solid foundations in the learning sciences,
                  computer science, education, and the social sciences. We
                  define learning at scale as the study of the technologies,
                  pedagogies, analyses, and theories of learning and teaching
                  that take place with a large number of learners and a high
                  ratio of learners to facilitators. The scale of these
                  environments often changes the very nature of the interaction
                  and learning experiences. We identify three types of
                  technologies that support scale in education: dedicated
                  content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs; dedicated tools,
                  such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and repurposed
                  platforms, such as social networks. We further identify five
                  areas that scale affects: learners, research and data,
                  adaptation, space and time, and pedagogy. Introducing the

                  effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
                  tutoring. “No tutoring” refers to instruction that teaches the
                  same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems
                  were divided by their granularity of the user interface
                  interaction into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based
                  tutoring systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have
                  step-based or substep-based granularities of interaction,
                  whereas most other tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or
                  CAL systems) have answer-based user interfaces. It is widely
                  believed as the granularity of tutoring decreases, the
                  effectiveness increases. In particular, when compared to No
                  tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring systems,
                  intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are
                  believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review
                  did not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the
                  effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79.
                  Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems was
                  0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.},

                  spatial information delivery and enhance higher education
                  practice. However, there is limited research on the impact of
                  mobile MR (MMR) within construction education and improvement
                  of the learners’ experience. With new building information
                  modelling (BIM) workflows being adopted within the
                  architecture, engineering and construction industry,
                  innovative MMR pedagogical delivery methods should be explored
                  to enhance this information-rich spatial technology workflow.
                  This paper outlines qualitative results derived through
                  thematic analysis of learner reflections from two
                  technology-enhanced lessons involving a lecture and a hands-on
                  workshop focussed on MMR-BIM delivered within postgraduate
                  construction education. Seventy participants across the two
                  lessons recruited from an Australian university participated
                  to answer the research question: ‘Does applied mobile mixed
                  reality create an enhanced learning environment for students?’
                  The results of the analysis suggest that using MMR-BIM can
                  result in an enhanced learning environment that facilitates
                  unique learning experiences, engagement and motivation.
                  However, the study outcome suggests that to understand the
                  processes leading to these learning aspects, further empirical
                  research on the topic is required. This paper is part of the

               virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, and various
               forms of mixed reality. These new media potentially offer
               extraordinary opportunities for enhancing both motivation and
               learning across a range of subject areas, student developmental
               levels, and educational settings. With the development of
               practical and affordable virtual reality and mixed reality,
               people now have the chance to experience immersive learning both
               in classrooms and informally in homes, libraries, and community

               American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software,
               and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose
               diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data
               sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once
               considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik
               Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of
               their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our
               lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies
               is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling
               personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless
               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this
               bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all
               kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended.
               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,

                  Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), i.e., Cyber-Physical

                  used in 2011 at the Hannover Fair and the topic has grown
                  every year not only on the fair. There are still several

               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and the
               opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and design.
               It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various technological
               trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon future urban,
               spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within architecture.

                 the Construction Industry},

  date        = {2008},
  abstract    = {The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest
                 challenges facing the construction industry. The Construction
                 Users Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their
                 workforce availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82
                 percent of the respondents reported experiencing work force
                 shortages on their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the
                 trend had worsened over the previous three years. One promising
                 solution to relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to
                 provide adequate and effective training. Many research efforts
                 on construction worker training have been conducted in the past
                 decade in order to address the need and benefits of
                 construction craft training. However, a quantitative analysis
                 of construction craft trainings benefits and costs from the
                 perspective of worker, project and company has rarely been
                 carried out. Providing quantifiable analysis regarding the
                 benefits and costs of training can help to solve the debate
                 existing in the industry regarding the value of craft labor
                 training and improve the effectiveness of craft training
                 programs. The research investigated existing major datasets
                 relevant with construction craft training developed by previous
                 research. Meanwhile, as part of this research, a craft director
                 training survey was administrated to measure training benefits
                 in productivity, turnover, absenteeism safety and rework, as
                 well as information such as core training subjects and common
                 barriers for training. The primary objective of the study is to
                 qualify the outcomes and effectiveness of strategies for
                 construction craft training. Four secondary objectives are
                 completed to help achieve the primary goal: (I) Identify the
                 major characteristics of construction training and major
                 factors affecting construction training; (II) Quantitatively
                 measure the outcomes of construction training on the individual
                 and project/company level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio
                 models based on the survey administrated by the study as well
                 as existing industry data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity
                 analysis to identify real multiskilling patterns among craft
                 workers in order to adopt multiskilling training strategies in
                 the construction industry.},

                 their 20s and 30s today have incomes no higher than the
                 previous generation at the same age and are worse off once
                 housing costs are considered. The wage gap between older and
                 younger workers has widened since the 2008 financial crisis and
                 shows no signs of closing. The outlook is uncertain, with young
                 people over-represented in jobs in sectors that are expected to
                 see lower employment growth in the long term, and vital
                 ‘stepping stone’ midskill jobs are in decline. So, as we emerge
                 from the pandemic, we must consider not simply what the impact
                 of the pandemic has been on young people since early in 2020,
                 but how well equipped they now are to face the future. Young
                 people we spoke to as part of this research overwhelmingly want
                 what previous generations wanted from work: secure, full-time
                 jobs with decent pay (at the real living wage) near where they
                 live. They also want to work with like-minded people, in jobs
                 and companies they believe in and that are well matched to
                 their skills and capabilities. If required, and with the right
                 support, they are willing to change career direction.
                 Nonetheless, they perceive that a lack of local jobs and
                 inequalities in local areas could hold them back from achieving
                 their aspirations.},

  abstract     = {This article describes and appraises the difficulties
                  experienced by British unions since 1979. During that period,
                  union membership has declined over 20 percent and three
                  successive Conservative governments have enacted labor
                  legislation opposed by unions. The author views the
                  government's strongly unfavorable treatment of unions as a
                  powerful force, but argues that economic and structural
                  changes, such as the growth of temporary and part-time workers
                  and the decline of the manufacturing sector, are likely to
                  have more lasting adverse effects. Unions are adopting various
                  strategies to try to counteract the decline of their
                  membership, including innovative organizing methods and
                  expanded services for members. The fate of the unions will
                  depend, the author concludes, on the success of those
                  strategies, changes in the British economy, and the Labour
                  Party's fortunes in future general elections.},

                  policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A
                  popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies
                  upon an equally strong vocational, education and training
                  (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the
                  dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such
                  arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question
                  through an examination of what the revitalisation of US
                  manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
                  extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
                  system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
                  Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
                  secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
                  that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system
                  overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems
                  that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill
                  eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training
                  innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing
                  industry.},

               would be to engage the students in sustained reasoning activity
               and to interact with the student based on a deep understanding of
               the students' behavior. This chapter begins by providing an
               overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The chapter comments on
               competing research goals in the field, followed by descriptions
               of two successful systems: (1) the Pittsburgh urban math project
               algebra tutor project and (2) the SHERLOCK project. These two
               systems are being deployed in real-world educational environments
               with substantial success. This chapter briefly describes the
               underlying theory and implementation of each system, to motivate
               later discussions. A description of the standard components in an
               intelligent tutoring system is also presented along with a
               discussion of human-computer interaction assessment issues unique
               to educational software. This chapter also provides a

                  collaborative learning environments that adapt their
                  characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
                  feedback, to improve individual students’ collaborative
                  interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can
                  automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and
                  ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While
                  there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning,
                  little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are
                  effective. Does relevant support improve student interactions
                  by providing just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe
                  they are receiving relevant support feel more accountable for
                  the collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
                  interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
                  have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
                  high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant
                  (APTA). To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled
                  study that demonstrated that our system provided students with
                  more relevant support and was more effective at improving
                  student learning than parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our
                  contributions involve generalizable techniques for
                  implementing ACLS that can function adaptively and
                  effectively, and the finding that adaptive support does indeed
                  improve student learning because of the relevance of the
                  support.},

                  research are learning to write short programs with the ACT
                  Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a
                  production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge,
                  called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to
                  solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance
                  as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains
                  an estimate of the probability that the student has learned
                  each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process
                  calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized
                  sequence of exercises to the student based on these
                  probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each
                  rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and

                  major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
                  carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
                  the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
                  three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
                  explored spatial skills, but never in the context of
                  vocational education and training (VET). This study sheds
                  light on the level and evolution of spatial skills in the
                  initial vocational training of carpenter apprentices in
                  Switzerland. Methods In this study, 726 subjects (98 females)
                  who were either carpenter apprentices, apprentices of another
                  profession, or high school students, took a test on spatial
                  skills with three parts: mental rotation, paper folding, and
                  orthographic projections. The first two parts are widely used
                  tests for spatial skills, while the last one was specifically
                  designed to address the 2D-3D transition that is a core skill
                  of carpenters. Results Carpenter apprentices do have higher
                  spatial skills than would be expected given their general
                  school level. In particular, their spatial skills were found
                  to be similar to those of high school students and superior to
                  those of apprentices of another profession. Carpenters’
                  spatial skills improve over the course of their
                  apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
                  trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
                  carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
                  the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
                  Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
                  over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
                  skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
                  develop further solutions that encourage further improvement
                  of teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.},

                  examined. Drawing on data from a 3-year study of the social
                  and pedagogical relationships between apprentices and older
                  workers in the English steel industry, the article proposes
                  that, building on Engeström's work, an ‘expansive’ as opposed
                  to a ‘restrictive’ approach to apprenticeship will not only
                  deliver the broader goals being set for apprenticeship
                  programmes around the world, but will also foster workplace
                  learning. The article offers a critique of Lave and Wenger's
                  novice to expert conceptualisation of apprenticeship and,
                  using data from employee learning logs, argues that

                  characteristics: epistemological, teleological, hierarchical
                  and pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be
                  adequate to identify vocational education and training across
                  jurisdictions, and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook
                  and Stevenson seek for vocational education and training what
                  Rushbrook calls an ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet
                  such a quest may degenerate into essentialism, and in any case
                  is vulnerable to being made obsolete by the changes that
                  vocational education and training is meant to be stimulating
                  and to equip us for life. The article concludes by arguing for
                  a definition of vocational education and training which is a
                  compound of the four general characteristics considered.},

                  Bohemian Region near the town of Ostrov (Czech Republic),
                  archaeologists excavated a structure of a wooden water well
                  lining with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in
                  height. Due to the excellent conservation of the oak timbers,
                  studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating
                  were possible. The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55
                  BC, which makes this well the oldest dendrochronologically
                  dated archaeological wooden construction worldwide. It is the
                  third well from the Early Neolithic period that has been
                  discovered in the Czech Republic within the last four years.
                  The design consists of grooved corner posts with inserted
                  planks. This type of construction reveals advanced technical
                  know-how and, till now, is the only known type from this
                  region and time period. Thanks to the combination of annually
                  resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring widths (TRWs), the
                  Czech oak TRW chronology has been significantly extended back
                  to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical identification of fragments from
                  the well filling show mainly oak (Quercus spp.) and hazel
                  (Corylus spp.), indicating a local forest composition

                  engineered timber product of global interest. The orthogonal,

                  and floor element as well as a linear timber member, able to
                  bear loads in- and out-of-plane. This article provides a
                  state-of-the-art report on some selected topics related to
                  CLT, in particular production and technology, characteristic
                  material properties, design and connections. Making use of
                  general information concerning the product’s development and
                  global market, the state of knowledge is briefly outlined,
                  including the newest findings and related references for
                  background information. In view of ongoing global activities,
                  a significant rise in production volume within the next decade
                  is expected. Prerequisites for the establishment of a solid
                  timber construction system using CLT are (1) standards
                  comprising the product, testing and design, (2) harmonized
                  load-bearing models for calculating CLT properties based on
                  the properties of the base material board, enabling relatively
                  fast use of local timber species and qualities, and (3) the
                  development of CLT adequate connection systems for economic
                  assembling and an increasing degree of utilization regarding
                  the load-bearing potential of CLT elements in the joints. The
                  establishment of a worldwide harmonized package of standards
                  is recommended as this would broaden the fields of application
                  for timber engineering and strengthen CLT in competition with

                  anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the
                  vastest amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
                  hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
                  construction are of fundamental importance for national and
                  global targets to combat climate change. At material level,
                  mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using
                  less of the same material) and substitution (using a different
                  material). This article investigates the latter, with a global
                  focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete
                  floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst
                  innovative, does not require any technological development nor
                  upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an
                  immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We

                  different levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction

                  (95\% confidence interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e
                  in the case of full uptake of the hybrid construction system
                  by 2050. Our analysis does not account for carbon
                  sequestration potential in timber, which would make the
                  savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a
                  1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions
                  generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
                  non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of
                  net-zero carbon buildings.},

  abstract     = {CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                  effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                  because their training has not fully prepared them to do so.
                  To address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                  systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                  'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                  learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                  information, to use resources effectively and innovatively,
                  and to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving
                  in practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have
                  developed study designs that use dynamic assessments to
                  measure what trainees have acquired in the past, as well as
                  what they are able to learn in the present. More recently,
                  researchers have also started to emphasise and measure whether
                  and how trainees take action to gain the information they need
                  to learn. Knowing that there are study designs and emerging
                  metrics for assessing PFL, the next question is how to design
                  instruction that helps trainees develop PFL capacities.
                  Although research evidence is still accumulating, the current
                  evidence base suggests training that encourages 'productive
                  failure' through guided discovery learning (i.e. where
                  trainees solve problems and perform tasks without direct
                  instruction, though often with some form of feedback) creates
                  challenging conditions that enhance learning and equip
                  trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation
                  for future learning and the associated capacity of being
                  adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                  practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                  assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                  explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in
                  the health care workplace to inform the design of instruction
                  for developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours
                  that relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential
                  sociocultural barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to
                  learn from their daily practice.},

               work, presenting scenarios, problem solving, metaphors, and
               techniques intended to avoid making mistakes. This book considers
               diverse user needs and context, real world successes and
               failures, and the future of NUI. It presents thirty scenarios,
               giving practitioners a multitude of considerations for making

               design for anyone and everyone involved in creating VR
               experiences. Without a clear understanding of the human side of
               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and
               pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration
               and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR
               execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of
               understanding human perception, interaction, design principles,
               and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR,
               such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various
               forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and
               pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR
               applications. This book is not just for VR designers, it is for
               managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers,
               students, educators, and user experience professionals. It is for
               the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at
               least the basics of the many aspects of VR design. The industry
               is rapidly evolving, and The VR Book stresses the importance of
               building prototypes, gathering feedback, and using adjustable
               processes to efficiently iterate towards success. It contains
               extensive details on the most important aspects of VR, more than
               600 applicable guidelines, and over 300 additional references.},

  abstract  = {It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized
               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method
               of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the
               most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge
               required for expert practice in fields from painting and
               sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation
               while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The
               differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods
               are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as
               a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills
               and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their
               uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand,
               target skills are not only continually in use by skilled
               practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of
               meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the
               learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional
               context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has
               serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that
               students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those
               implications through a proposal for the retooling of
               apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive
               skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new
               cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and
               problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as
               reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper
               is as follows: In the first section, we discuss briefly what we
               believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and
               pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural
               features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general,
               what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section
               we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical
               "success models," which we believe exemplify aspects of
               apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning
               skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt
               to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to
               the development of not only the cognitive, but also the
               metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final
               section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and
               characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
               for the design of learning environments, where "environment"
               includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods
               employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the
               sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive
               apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional
               apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in
               designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods,
               materials, and technologies.},

                  non-reflecting educators use an instrumental problem-solving

               BOOK OF THE YEARIn this ground-breaking blend of imaginative
               storytelling and scientific forecasting, a pioneering AI expert
               and a leading writer of speculative fiction join forces to answer
               an imperative question: How will artificial intelligence change
               our world within twenty years?AI will be the defining development
               of the twenty-first century. Within two decades, aspects of daily
               human life will be unrecognizable. AI will generate unprecedented
               wealth, revolutionize medicine and education through
               human-machine symbiosis, and create brand new forms of
               communication and entertainment. In liberating us from routine
               work, however, AI will also challenge the organizing principles
               of our economic and social order. Meanwhile, AI will bring new
               risks in the form of autonomous weapons and smart technology that
               inherits human bias. AI is at a tipping point, and people need to
               wake up-both to AI's radiant pathways and its existential perils
               for life as we know it. In this provocative, utterly original
               work of "scientific fiction," Kai-Fu Lee, the former president of
               Google China and bestselling author of AI Superpowers, joins
               forces with celebrated novelist Chen Qiufan to imagine our world
               in 2041 and how it will be shaped by AI. In ten gripping short
               stories, set twenty years in the future, they introduce readers
               to an array of eye-opening 2041 settings: In San Francisco, a new
               industry, "job reallocation," arises to serve displaced workers
               In Tokyo, a music fan is swept up in an immersive form of
               celebrity worship In Mumbai, a teenage girl rebels when AI gets
               in the way of romance In Seoul, virtual teachers offer orphaned
               twins new ways to learn and connect In Munich, a rogue quantum
               computer scientist's revenge plot imperils the world By gazing
               toward a not-so-distant horizon, AI 2041 offers urgent insights
               into our collective future-while reminding readers that,
               ultimately, humankind remains the author of its destiny.},

                  medicine and the empirical evidence available. This theory
                  describes expertise development as the progression through a
                  series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized
                  by functionally different knowledge structures underlying
                  performance. The first phase is characterized by the
                  accumulation of causal knowledge about disease and its
                  consequences. Through experience with real cases, this
                  knowledge transforms into narrative structures called illness
                  scripts. The cognitive mechanisms responsible for this
                  transition are: Encapsulation of elaborated knowledge into
                  high level but simplified causal models or even diagnostic
                  categories and tuning through the inclusion of contextual
                  information. The third phase is characterized by the use of
                  episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of new
                  cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different
                  phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process.
                  These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any
                  more in subsequent phases in the development of expertise,
                  remain available for use when ontologically more recently
                  acquired structures fail to produce an adequate representation
                  of a clinical problem.},

               each project. It addresses three specific industry aspects: the
               “players” the “processes,” and “practices” — all spelled out in a
               way that promotes readers' understanding. An effective overview

               the magnificent work it produces, helps demonstrates the
               worldwide impact of the industry. Chapter topics include The
               construction industry at large, the “players” in construction,
               the sequence of a project, and communications and documentation.
               Appendices cover: a narrative of a project sequence; the concept
               and application of building codes and other construction
               regulations; sample specification (on regulations); a project
               checklist; costing; trade associations, standards-generating

               by mapping situations to actions so as to maximize cumulative
               rewards. In recent years RL has achieved great success in
               inducing effective pedagogical policies for various interactive
               e-learning environments. However, it is often prohibitive to
               identify the critical pedagogical decisions that actually
               contribute to desirable learning outcomes. In this work, by
               utilizing the RL framework we defined critical decisions to be
               those states in which the agent has to take the optimal actions,
               and subsequently, the Critical policy as carrying out optimal
               actions in the critical states while acting randomly in others.
               We proposed a general Critical-RL framework for identifying
               critical decisions and inducing a Critical policy. The
               effectiveness of our Critical-RL framework is empirically
               evaluated from two perspectives: whether optimal actions must be
               carried out in critical states (the necessary hypothesis) and
               whether only carrying out optimal actions in critical states is
               as effective as a fully-executed RL policy (the sufficient
               hypothesis). Our results confirmed both hypotheses.},

                  propose that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three
                  specific behaviors (i.e., socialization, externalization, and
                  internalization) and they are influenced by four antecedents
                  (trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A
                  survey was conducted to collect data from 258 knowledge
                  workers who worked on complex product development projects.
                  Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The
                  results demonstrate that trust, self-efficacy, knowledge
                  tacitness, and IT support significantly affect the
                  externalization and internalization behaviors, and trust and
                  IT support significantly affect the socialization behavior.
                  This study is helpful to organizations where it is critical
                  for employees to share tacit knowledge. It suggests that tacit
                  knowledge is difficult to share and organizations should
                  nurture mutual trust between employees, enhance their
                  self-efficacy, and provide sufficient IT support so that they
                  are more likely to engage in tacit knowledge sharing.},

                  These network effects influence consumer decisions and affect
                  companies’ ability to compete. Strategists have developed some
                  well-known rules for navigating business environments with
                  network effects. “Move first” is one, and “get big fast” is
                  another. In a study of dozens of companies, however, the
                  authors found that quite often the conventional wisdom was
                  dead wrong. And when the rules failed, the reason was always
                  the same: Companies trip up when they try to attract large
                  volumes of customers without understanding (1) the strength of
                  mutual attraction among various customer groups and (2) the
                  extent of asymmetric attraction among them. Looking at
                  examples such as TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, and the New York
                  Times, the authors offer strategies for competing in markets
                  with network effects. New entrants should focus on customer
                  groups that they are uniquely positioned to serve or appeal to
                  the most attractive customers in a market. Incumbents pursuing
                  growth strategies in adjacent markets or new geographies
                  should consider how similar the needs of new customers are to
                  those of existing customers. Offering complements also allows
                  incumbents to reach additional customer groups.},

               knowledge in the management literature is a dichotomy between
               tacit and explicit. Even the knowledge management literature
               tends to view knowledge on a limited number of dimensions,
               whether this is in discussions of knowledge as a commodity or the
               process of knowing. A review of knowledge from first principles
               shows that knowledge has different degrees of validity, is highly
               heterogeneous and has complicated temporal and social aspects. A
               model of knowledge based on these aspects is presented. Comparing
               the four dimensions of knowledge with knowledge as a process
               opens up a more holistic view of knowledge management and helps
               articulate some of the key differences within streams of research
               in the field. This holistic perspective is also compatible with
               Polanyi's original complex conception of tacit knowledge, which
               drew heavily on Gestalt theory, a theory that examines the
               perception of "wholes". The dual perspectives of a
               multi-dimensional conception of knowledge as a commodity and a
               holistic perspective on knowledge management expands the avenues
               of potential research and improves our ability to put knowledge

               than we can tell." Many researchers in the knowledge management
               community have used the idea of tacit knowledge to draw a
               distinction between that which cannot be formally represented
               (tacit knowledge) and knowledge which can be so represented
               (explicit knowledge). I argue that the deference that knowledge
               management researchers give to tacit knowledge hinders
               potentially fruitful work for two important reasons. First, the
               inability to explicate knowledge does not imply that the
               knowledge cannot be formally represented. Second, assuming the
               inability to formalize tacit knowledge as it exists in the minds
               of people does not exclude the possibility that computer systems
               might perform the same tasks using alternative representations.
               By reviewing work from artificial intelligence, I will argue that
               a richer model of cognition and knowledge representation is

               intelligent behavior.What can artificial intelligence teach us
               about the mind? If AI's underlying concept is that thinking is a
               computational process, then how can computation illuminate
               thinking? It's a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the
               buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer
               systems that learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of
               data. This is what powers a driverless car, for example. In this
               book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to “good old
               fashioned artificial intelligence,” which is based not on heaps
               of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind
               of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that
               depart from previous patterns—as we do in real life, when, for
               example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista
               informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
               of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that
               passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he
               proposes another way to test for intelligence—the Winograd Schema
               Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. “If our goal is
               to understand intelligent behavior, we had better understand the
               difference between making it and faking it,” he observes. He
               identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the
               capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to
               represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more
               and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without
               common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.},

               What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between
               one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that
               prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree
               to share your family's full medical history if you were told that
               it would help researchers find a cure for cancer?These are just
               some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach
               the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign
               supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to
               watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail.
               But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important
               decisions--in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and
               money--they raise questions about what we want our world to look

                  viewpoint that virtual reality software could be a new focus
                  of direction in the development of training tools in medical
                  education. We carried out a panel discussion at the Center for
                  Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference, prompted by the study,
                  "The Responses of Medical General Practitioners to
                  Unreasonable Patient Demand for Antibiotics--A Study of
                  Medical Ethics Using Immersive Virtual Reality" (1). METHODS:
                  In Pan et al.'s study, 21 general practitioners (GPs) and GP
                  trainees took part in a videoed, 15-min virtual reality
                  scenario involving unnecessary patient demands for
                  antibiotics. This paper was discussed in-depth at the Center
                  for Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference; the content of this
                  paper is a culmination of findings and feedback from the panel
                  discussion. The experts involved have backgrounds in virtual
                  reality, general practice, medicines management, medical
                  education and training, ethics, and philosophy. VIEWPOINT:
                  Virtual reality is an unexplored methodology to instigate
                  positive behavioral change among clinicians where other
                  methods have been unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial
                  stewardship. There are several arguments in favor of use of
                  virtual reality in medical education: it can be used for
                  "difficult to simulate" scenarios and to standardize a
                  scenario, for example, for use in exams. However, there are
                  limitations to its usefulness because of the cost implications
                  and the lack of evidence that it results in demonstrable
                  behavior change.},

  abstract  = {Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill,
               play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus
               intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as
               possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the
               people who got a head start. But if you take a closer look at the
               world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel
               laureates, you'll find that early specialization is the
               exception, not the rule. David Epstein, author of the New York
               Times bestseller The Sports Gene, studied the world's most
               successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters
               and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially
               those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not
               specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their
               path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on
               one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make
               connections their more specialized peers can't spy from deep in
               their hyperfocused trenches. As experts silo themselves further
               while computers master more of the skills once reserved for
               highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace
               diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.
               Our obsession with getting a head start is understandable; early
               specialization feels efficient. But Epstein marshals an enormous
               body of scientific research to argue that we should all actively
               cultivate inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn.
               Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The
               most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening
               their knowledge in a single area. Provocative, rigorous, and
               engrossing, Range explains how to maintain the benefits of
               breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and
               delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes,
               even demands, hyperspecialization.},

               and motor skills. The future of work will increasingly feature
               human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks
               and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning
               in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants,
               where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they
               are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we
               explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that
               help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by
               providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized
               experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse
               than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and
               learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but
               was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at
               all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even
               when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel
               learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy,
               with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be
               used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates
               how even noisy labels can increase the machine’s accuracy.},

                  metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and
                  emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an
                  extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of
                  variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy,
                  volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a
                  comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has
                  become one of the most important areas of research within
                  educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                  analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne
                  and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and
                  Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the
                  following aspects: (a) history and development, (b)
                  description of the model (including the model figures), (c)
                  empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on
                  the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of
                  aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how
                  they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion,
                  (d) top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In
                  the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                  meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                  extracted. Further, four future lines of research are
                  proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the
                  SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from
                  which to conduct research and on which students can be taught
                  to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the
                  available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential
                  effects of SRL models in light of differences in students'
                  developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and
                  teachers need to start applying these differential effects of
                  the SRL models and theories to enhance students' learning and
                  SRL skills.},

                  experiences for engineering students. However, such
                  practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to
                  allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring
                  the job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed
                  to investigate how job demands, job control, and social
                  support affect interns' use of different learning strategies.
                  Method The study utilized data collected from a sample of
                  engineering students (n =?118) who completed a required
                  internship during their degree. The data were analyzed using a
                  structural equation modeling approach including latent
                  factors. Results Job demands were found to be a relevant and
                  significant driver of students' shared regulation (e.g.,
                  asking for feedback), self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use
                  of codified information), efforts to relate theory to practice
                  (e.g., connecting workplace experience with theoretical
                  knowledge), and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g.,
                  lack of adaptation to work situations), but not of external
                  regulation (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job
                  control, however, was not found to be a positive or
                  significant driver of student learning. Social support was
                  found to be a relevant and significant predictor of external
                  and shared regulation but not of the other learning
                  activities. Conclusions This study provided mixed findings
                  regarding key hypotheses central to the JDCS model, generating
                  rather poor evidence supporting it. In fact, job demands, job
                  control, and social support exhibited much less explanatory
                  power than expected for engineering students' learning during
                  internships.},

                  was gained within the community of practice regarding teaching

                  teaching practice improved. It is suggested that models of

                  learner-related factors (level of study in the L2, knowledge

                  French as a second language French sentences were presented on

               Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics, this is the ultimate guide to
               how to Think Like a FreakThe Freakonomics books have come to
               stand for something: challenging conventional wisdom; using data
               rather than emotion to answer questions; and learning to unravel
               the world's secret codes. Now Levitt and Dubner have gathered up
               what they have learned and turned it into a readable and
               practical toolkit for thinking differently - thinking, that is,
               like a Freak. Whether you are interested in the best way to
               improve your odds in penalty kicks, or in major global reforms,
               here is a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems.
               Along the way, you'll learn how the techniques of a Japanese
               hot-dog-eating champion can help you, the reason an Australian
               doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, why Nigerian
               e-mail scammers make a point of saying they're from Nigeria, and
               why Van Halen's demanding tour contract banning brown M\&Ms was
               really a safety measure. You'll learn why sometimes it's best to
               put away your moral compass, and smarter to think like a child.
               You will be given a master class in incentives-because for better
               or worse, incentives rule our world. And you will learn to quit
               before you fail, because you can't solve tomorrow's problem if
               you aren't willing to abandon today's dud.Levitt and Dubner see
               the world like no one else. Now you can too. Never before have
               such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing - and so much fun to

                  comes from the process itself. The author predicts this will
                  change as the generation raised on the engagement of games no
                  longer accepts the historical but unnecessary separation of
                  fun and learning. The author offers the games world as an
                  example of the process itself being motivating to the user. He
                  ascribes this to “gameplay”, the techniques used by game
                  designers to keep players engaged. The author suggests several
                  ways to bring the motivation of gameplay into education, and
                  predicts that gameplay will eventually become the criterion by
                  which students choose their courses.},

  abstract     = {Workforce training is needed throughout the construction
                  industry to create and maintain competent workers;
                  unfortunately, most construction training and education
                  research focuses on university student education. Integrating
                  education science theory into construction training has the
                  potential to improve industry training, but the status of this
                  integration has not been well articulated. To address this
                  gap, this article undertakes a state-of-the-art review of
                  education theory–integrated construction training for current
                  industry professionals. To measure the extent of educational
                  theory integration, this article identifies and summarizes
                  studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency
                  of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of
                  student learning outcomes, and identifies and compares
                  commonly used words within the identified construction
                  training literature and foundational educational theory
                  literature. This article presents a systematic review of
                  published construction workforce training studies that have
                  incorporated educational theory in the design and
                  implementation of the training. The results reveal that, of
                  the 15 construction training studies that met the inclusion
                  criteria, two-thirds (2/3) focused on worker safety and only
                  three studies (20\%) targeted managers or designers. Fewer
                  than 35\% of terms that were identified as frequently used
                  terms in the published construction training studies were
                  categorized as educational. The results of this study provide
                  a baseline of education theory–integrated construction
                  training research, from which gaps and best practices can be
                  identified and implemented to improve construction industry

                the same time, a growing volume of research connects cognitive
                science theories with tangible/embodied interactions (TEI) and
                virtual reality (VR) to offer novel means to support spatial
                cognition. But very few VR-TEI systems are specifically designed
                to support spatial ability, nor are they evaluated with respect
                to spatial ability. In this paper, we present the background,
                approach, and evaluation of TASC (Tangibles for Augmenting
                Spatial Cognition), a VR-TEI system built to support spatial
                perspective taking ability. We tested 3 conditions (tangible VR,

                change in performance on a perspective taking test revealed that

               of creativity. Learn how: a slow hunch can be much more valuable
               than a Eureka moment; the connected 'hive mind' is smarter than
               the lone thinker; where you think matters just as much as what
               you're thinking; and, the best ideas come from building on the
               ideas and inventions of others. From the Renaissance to
               satellites, medical breakthroughs to social media, Charles Darwin
               to Marconi, Steven Johnson shows how, by recognising where and

                intelligence (AI) have been around for centuries, and can be
                traced back to at least to the 14 th century. Artificial
                Intelligence in Education (AIED) is a much younger discipline,
                but during the last 25 years there have been achievements in a
                number of fields which have made impact on education. Critical
                voices have been raised against the over-optimism in
                contemporary AI research. Less have been written about the high
                expectation of AIED and its potential impact on education. The
                aim of this study was to analyse and discuss AIED from the
                teacher perspective. This study was carried out as a
                SWOT-analysis, with data gathered from a literature study. Main
                keywords in the literature search were: artificial intelligence,
                artificial intelligence in education, AIED, teacher perspective,
                education and teacher. Themes and patterns in the four main
                categories where further processed as a deductive-inductive
                thematic analysis. Findings indicates that there are both
                promises and threats for the teacher in the contemporary AIED.
                In several aspects the field seems to be in a state of hype but
                as other hype areas there is a potential for maturing and with
                concrete applications in daily teaching and learning activities.
                Recommendations is to learn from traditional AI and to open up
                for an informative and nuanced discussion concerning the role of
                AI in education. Otherwise there is a risk for artificial

               performance, while minimising economic cost and thus ensuring
               social accessibility. Across the UK, the construction industry is
               characterised by several regional differences, including the
               level of uptake of offsite production. If Scottish wood is
               produced through good silvicultural practices and is properly
               utilised in the construction sector, the import of raw material
               from other countries can be drastically reduced, with several
               advantages. In Scotland, innovation in the construction sector is
               often driven by large companies that can invest a quota of their
               turnover in research and development to create new products,
               experiment with new materials or develop more efficient methods
               of erection. The most significant drivers for offsite
               construction are considered by the Scottish respondents to be
               government policies, the housing shortage and environmental
               credentials, whereas less importance is attached to advanced
               systems and production methods.},

                of these students in STEM careers. While many first-year college
                engineering programs and high schools with pre-engineering
                curriculum have incorporated spatial visualization training into
                their courses, there is no reason why spatial visualization
                training could not start at elementary school. At the older age
                groups, the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Rotations
                (PSVT:R), which is recognized as a gold standard assessment
                tool, is used to measure students’ learning gains in their
                spatial skills. However, it not suitable for elementary school
                grades. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego
                developed an assembly pre- and post- test based upon a timed
                Lego™ exercise which would lend itself well to K-12 students.},

                  lab exercises utilizing I-DEAS software were written
                  specifically for this course. The course is 3-credits (quarter
                  system) with two hours of lecture and two hours of computer
                  lab each week. It was offered at Michigan Technological
                  University (MTU) for the first time during the 1993 Fall term
                  and has been offered each fall since that time. The objective
                  of the course is to provide the prerequisite spatial skills
                  needed by students to succeed in their subsequent engineering
                  graphics courses. Assessment for the course has been

                  measured. A desktop display as well as the Gear VR were used

                  Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the
                  relationship between the probability of correct answers and
                  completion times, while linear regression was used to evaluate
                  effects and interactions of following factors on test
                  completion times: the users’ gender and primary hand, test
                  type and device used. The findings were that while the

               play in observational learning, the scope of modeling influences,
               the types of people most susceptible to modeling influences, and
               the relative effectiveness of models presented in live action, in

                  given short shrift to the dissertation literature review. This
                  article suggests criteria to evaluate the quality of
                  dissertation literature reviews and reports a study that
                  examined dissertations at three universities. Acquiring the
                  skills and knowledge required to be education scholars, able
                  to analyze and synthesize the research in a field of
                  specialization, should be the focal, integrative activity of
                  predissertation doctoral education. Such scholarship is a
                  prerequisite for increased methodological sophistication and
                  for improving the usefulness of education research.},

               representations and suggest that these lead to different design
               principles and learning activities. Multiple representations can
               play a complementary role when learners exploit differences in
               their form and content by switching between and selecting the
               appropriate representation for the task at hand. Constraining
               benefits are achieved when learners can profit from the support
               of a familiar representation to understand a new and complex
               representation. Finally, if learners abstract across multiple
               representations, they can construct a deeper understanding of the
               nature of the representations and the domain they represent. This
               chapter updates a review of studies that have used multiple
               representations for these purposes and identifies some of the

  abstract    = {Workforce training is needed throughout the construction
                 industry to create and maintain competent workers;
                 unfortunately, most construction training and education
                 research focuses on university student education. The focus of
                 this dissertation research is the current state of
                 educational-theory embedded construction workforce training,
                 how such trainings are effective, and how they may be further
                 optimized based on established educational theory. This is
                 accomplished through a review of construction training for
                 current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
                 criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the
                 creation of a framework for construction training. There is a
                 lack of recommendations for improvement of construction
                 training across the industry. To establish the current state of
                 construction industry training, a review of education
                 theory-integrated training for construction professionals is
                 undertaken. To measure the extent of educational theory
                 integration, this dissertation summarizes studies that meet
                 inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency of occurrence of
                 Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of student learning
                 outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly used words
                 within the identified construction training literature and
                 foundational educational theory literature. The results provide
                 a baseline of education theory-integrated construction training
                 research, from which gaps and best practices can be identified.
                 Existing construction training programs are not properly
                 measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
                 methodologies used in construction trainings published in
                 archival literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
                 of training programs. These practices are compared against the
                 Kirkpatrick Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment
                 methodologies in the literature are synthesized with
                 corresponding levels found in the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly
                 integrating educational theory into construction workforce
                 training has the potential to improve industry training;
                 however, there is a dearth of studies that present details of
                 this integration process. To address this gap, a training
                 framework is created to educate material installers on material
                 properties, selection, and installation. This framework is
                 based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
                 principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
                 similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
                 training implementation. The created framework culminates by
                 establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed
                 training modules.},

                  presents a framework for construction industry training

                  evaluation science and developed from a review of archival
                  construction industry training literature. Inclusion criteria
                  for the evaluated studies are: archival training studies
                  focused on the construction industry workforce and integration
                  of educational theory in training creation or implementation.
                  Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case
                  review is presented detailing assessment practices and
                  results. The assessment practices are then synthesized with

                  explored whether embodied experiences via IVET would elicit
                  greater self-other merging, favorable attitudes, and helping
                  toward persons with disabilities compared to traditional
                  perspective taking, which relies on imagination to put the
                  self in another person's shoes. Trait dispositions to feel
                  concern for others was tested as a moderating variable.
                  Participants in the embodied experiences (EE) condition were
                  exposed to a red-green colorblind simulation using IVET while
                  participants in the perspective taking (PT) condition were

                 project, and no contractor would be able to operate without the
                 skilled laborers that they employ. The construction industry
                 has been subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last
                 two decades for many reasons, including the poor image of
                 construction workers among the public, inadequate training
                 measures, and an aging workforce. Reviewing the literature on
                 the matter shows that the leading cause of shortage is low pay
                 and increasing age of the workforce overall, while the demand
                 for labor grows at a faster rate than the supply of labor
                 grows. Poor worker retention practices were also identified as
                 a cause for shortage and a reason for workers leaving the
                 industry, and proper retention tactics are assessed, including
                 monetary and non-monetary considerations for workers in order
                 to foster a better employer-employee relationship. Recruiting
                 practices among labor unions and contractors are also assessed
                 through interviews and research, with the results suggesting
                 that a greater emphasis should be put on improving the image of
                 construction workers in the public eye, increasing the prestige
                 of a job in construction and leading to increased participation

                  help improve construction industry performance as well as meet
                  new market demands through the provision of improved,
                  adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment
                  of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect
                  the end result and be counterproductive. It is therefore
                  imperative that the construction industry stakeholders learn
                  and appreciate the specifics, merits, as well as the risks
                  associated with OSP systems in order to achieve the desired
                  outcomes and consequently improve industry
                  performance.On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to
                  facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to be
                  particularly effective where a great deal of independence is
                  granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been
                  criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid
                  of the actual training context. In order to address the
                  problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR)
                  solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such
                  VR solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free
                  environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences
                  often faced on real construction projects. The proffered
                  solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new
                  working conditions associated with OSP practices. While the
                  ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on a construction
                  site, the environment predominantly targets professionals,
                  such as project managers, construction managers, architects,
                  designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow
                  multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome
                  ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR
                  environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by
                  professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety
                  issues to occur; where the implications of which can be
                  evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR
                  environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
                  associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go
                  wrong’ and consequently allows users not only to ‘experience’
                  the resulting implications but also to reflect on those
                  implications as part of the learning process. This paper
                  discusses and presents the prototype for the first development
                  phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the
                  prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
                  industry, the research community, and academia from different
                  EU countries, the data used in developing the prototype was
                  constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the
                  generalisability of results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The UK construction industry has long been criticized
                  for its poor performance, poor image and inability to attract
                  and retain workers. Offsite production (OSP) under the
                  overarching umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC)
                  was sought by the UK Government to ameliorate the UK
                  construction industry, meet market demands and overcome manual
                  skill shortages. Nevertheless, professional skills shortages
                  are argued to be as acute as manual skills shortfalls. In this
                  respect, industry?academia collaboration is anticipated to
                  provide professional skills needed for OSP and, hence, effect
                  change. This paper reports the findings from the first stage
                  of an ongoing triangulated research project. In this context,
                  a survey was carried out to capture the perceptions of both
                  the UK construction industry and academia with respect to OSP
                  and preferable means for collaboration, in an attempt to
                  explore common grounds for possible collaborations. A
                  quantitative approach was primarily used for data collection
                  and analysis. The findings from 36 large construction
                  organizations (representing a 20\% response rate) and 20
                  construction-related higher-education institutions
                  (representing a 32\% response rate) suggested that although
                  the industry considered OSP to be the future of the UK
                  construction industry, there seemed to be uncertainty about
                  what OSP actually entailed. Notwithstanding these issues,
                  academia either did not know or refuted that OSP is the future
                  of the construction industry, hence suggesting a lack of
                  shared understanding between industry and academia with
                  respect to skills requirements and preferred means for
                  collaboration. Further research is needed to bridge the gap
                  between these apparent polarized views.},

  abstract  = {Open Building Manufacturing (ManuBuild) aims to promote the
               European construction industry beyond the state of the art.
               However, this requires the different stakeholders to be well
               informed of what ‘Open Building Manufacturing’ actually entails
               with respect to understanding the underlying concepts, benefits
               and risks. This is further challenged by the ‘traditional ways of
               learning’ which have been predominantly criticised for being
               entrenched in theories with little or no emphasis on practical
               issues. Experiential learning has long been suggested to overcome
               the problems associated with the traditional ways of learning. In
               this respect, it has the dual benefit of appealing to adult
               learner’s experience base, as well as increasing the likelihood
               of performance change through training. On-the-job-training (OJT)
               is usually sought to enable ‘experiential’ learning; and it is
               argued to be particularly effective in complex tasks, where a
               great deal of independence is granted to the task performer.
               However, OJT has been criticised for being expensive, limited,
               and devoid of the actual training context. Consequently, in order
               to address the problems encountered with OJT, virtual reality
               (VR) solutions have been proposed to provide a risk free
               environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences
               often faced on real construction projects. Since ManuBuild aims
               to promote the EU construction industry beyond the state of the
               art; training and education therefore needs also to go beyond the
               state of the art in order to meet future industry needs and
               expectations. Hence, a VR interactive learning environment was
               suggested for Open Building Manufacturing training to allow
               experiential learning to take place in a risk free environment,
               and consequently overcome the problems associated with OJT. This
               chapter discusses the development, testing, and validation of
               this prototype.},

                   remain a global concern within the construction industry.
                   While education and training of personnel offer well known
                   approaches for establishing a safe work environment, Serious
                   Games in Virtual Reality (VR) is being increasingly
                   investigated as a complementary approach for learning. They

                   approach for the automated assessment of players’ data. The
                   proposed method gathers and processes the data within a
                   serious game for instant personalized feedback. The
                   application focuses on close calls and contact collisions
                   between construction workers and hazards like equipment,
                   harmful substances, or restricted work zones. The results

                   information previously unavailable, or very hard or

                  Computers and Human Behavior, 25(2), 450–457, 2005). Our
                  original work operationalized three instructional roles as
                  simulated through pedagogical agents, and demonstrated the
                  effectiveness of these agent roles on learning and motivation.
                  Since the publication of our work, pedagogical agent research
                  has expanded its scope from the provision of intelligent
                  guidance to a broad interest in agents’ social and affective
                  support for learners. We discuss current progress in
                  pedagogical agent roles and capabilities, and speculate about
                  the future of agent role design. We expect that optimizing the
                  roles of artificial beings including on-screen agents and
                  robots will continue to interest the educational technology

               4.0 is based on a confluence of trends and technologies that
               promise to reshape the way built environment assets are designed,

               evidence-based e-learning design. Since the first edition of this
               book, e-learning has grown to account for at least 40\% of all
               training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail to
               reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency.
               This guide provides research-based guidelines on how best to
               present content with text, graphics, and audio as well as the
               conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This
               updated fourth edition describes the guidelines, psychology, and
               applications for ways to improve learning through personalization
               techniques, coherence, animations, and a new chapter on
               evidence-based game design. The chapter on the Cognitive Theory
               of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms of cognitive load
               which are revisited throughout each chapter as the psychological
               basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on engagement in
               learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews of how to
               leverage worked examples, practice, online collaboration, and
               learner control to optimize learning. The updated instructor's
               materials include a syllabus, assignments, storyboard projects,
               and test items that you can adapt to your own course schedule and
               students. Co-authored by the most productive instructional
               research scientist in the world, Dr. Richard E. Mayer, this book
               distills copious e-learning research into a practical manual for
               improving learning through optimal design and delivery. Get up to
               date on the latest e-learning research Adopt best practices for
               communicating information effectively Use evidence-based
               techniques to engage your learners Replace popular instructional
               ideas, such as learning styles with evidence-based guidelines
               Apply evidence-based design techniques to optimize learning games
               e-Learning continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the
               classroom, and correspondingly, has become a focus among
               researchers in learning-related fields. New findings from
               research laboratories can inform the design and development of
               e-learning. However, much of this research published in technical
               journals is inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning
               material. By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume
               and translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning
               and the Science of Instruction has become an essential resource

                  digitization of the value chain of a product and improving
                  productivity through a variety of technologies and automated

                  shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
                  construction sector in the European Union Member States,
                  foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of
                  people is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which
                  also includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages
                  in the EU are expected to increase in the future due to a
                  declining population and an ageing workforce. In order to
                  recognize and forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use
                  a variety of instruments but they do not answer as to whether
                  it is possible to use migrant labour to appease those
                  shortages. There are several systems used to classify labour
                  shortages in the EU Member states. Most of the countries
                  classify labour shortages in relation to different sectors or
                  occupation groups as well as by skill levels, but in some
                  Member States, classification is made according to the type of
                  employment. Instruments used to measure labour shortages
                  significantly differ from country to country. Several criteria
                  are used for creating lists of shortage occupations and most
                  of the criteria include demand side and supply side criteria.
                  A majority of the Member States are facing labour and skill
                  shortages in various sectors and the construction sector is
                  not an exception. As total employment in the construction
                  sector decreased, so did the share of employed migrants.
                  Labour shortages in the construction sector can be eased by
                  the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
                  unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
                  low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
                  the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be
                  working, which has an impact on the development and
                  implementation dynamic of Construction 4.0.},

                  (Yizit and Yezim Denis, 2018) to promote knowledge-based
                  skills in various sectors in Malaysia. Anticipating this
                  change, the Malaysian Government initiated Technical
                  Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program to address
                  the issue during the early 90’s. However, the current highly
                  pedagogical supply driven TVET system has not addressed the
                  need to effectively upskill and reskill workforce talents to

                4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
                to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
                digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
                authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
                fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
                constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
                developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
                the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal
                fragmentation and to take a holistic approach to the
                improvements needed in the industry. In this study, a literature
                review of Industry 4.0 and its influence on the construction
                sector was undertaken. Based on this systematic literature
                review, the authors define the Construction 4.0 framework and
                provide its benefits and barriers to implementation. A key
                finding of the study is that building information modeling, and
                a common data environment form the key foundation for the
                implementation of the Construction 4.0 framework. In defining
                the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper described its
                components and how its implementation is likely to proceed. The
                authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0, the industry
                can transform itself into a highly efficient, quality-centered,
                and safe industry capable of successfully delivering the demands

                  benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality,
                  this concept has not gained much attention in the construction
                  industry. This development is founded in the fact that the
                  far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and
                  automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown.
                  Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is
                  to explore the state of the art as well as the state of
                  practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the
                  construction industry by pointing out the political, economic,
                  social, technological, environmental and legal implications of
                  its adoption. In this context, we present the results of our
                  triangulation approach, which consists of a comprehensive
                  systematic literature review and case study research, by
                  illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain model.
                  Additionally, we provide recommendations for further research
                  within a research agenda.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTThe UK is set to become Europe?s largest construction
                  market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity
                  performance is regarded as weak, with low skills levels
                  considered to be a key contributory factor. Consequently,
                  off-site construction has been identified by the UK Government
                  as a vehicle for improving productivity levels if the skills
                  deficiencies in this particular market segment can be
                  addressed. A series of projects were, therefore, launched by
                  the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) to
                  encourage an R\&D approach to skills and development
                  application in the workplace. This paper reports on one of
                  these research projects, a University and Industry
                  collaboration between two of the largest off-site timber
                  platform frame manufacturers in the UK. The paper explains how
                  a needs analysis process was utilised to develop skills
                  training content tailored to the immediate needs of the
                  industry partners. It also explores how working with academia
                  and a wider community of stakeholders allowed this training
                  content to result in sector-level impact via knowledge
                  exchange activities and generic skills material creation.
                  Finally, the novel approach of utilising ?Hoshin? planning to
                  form a larger regional Offsite HUB (Scotland) Community of
                  Practice, with a developed plan for collaboration aligned with
                  international off-site research objectives, is also explained.
                  The case study presented in this paper is evidence of success
                  in mobilising industry through creating communities of
                  practice to advance the construction sector regionally. It
                  also provides a generalisable method that is reproducible by
                  other university?industry cohorts in order to realise shared

  abstract     = {PurposeThe construction industry is well known for its high
                  accident rate and many practitioners consider a preventative
                  approach to be the most important means of bringing about
                  improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
                  research and the weaknesses of existing preventative
                  approaches and then to describe and illustrate a new
                  application involving the use of a multi‐dimensional
                  simulation tool – Construction Virtual Prototyping
                  (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA literature review was
                  conducted to investigate previous studies of hazard
                  identification and safety management and to develop the new
                  approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the research
                  study explored the use of computer simulation techniques to
                  create virtual environments where users can explore and
                  identify construction hazards. Specifically, virtual
                  prototyping technology was deployed to develop typical
                  construction scenarios in which unsafe or hazardous incidents
                  occur. In a case study, the users' performance was evaluated
                  based on their responses to incidents within the virtual
                  environment and the effectiveness of the computer simulation
                  system established though interviews with the safety project
                  management team.FindingsThe opinions and suggestions provided
                  by the interviewees led to the initial conclusion that the
                  simulation tool was useful in assisting the safety management
                  team's hazard identification process during the early design
                  stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an innovative
                  method to support the management team's reviews of
                  construction site safety. The system utilises
                  three‐dimensional modelling and four‐dimensional simulation of
                  worker behaviour, a configuration that has previously not been
                  employed in construction simulations. An illustration of the
                  method's use is also provided, together with a consideration
                  of its strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract     = {In 1965 a political initiative was taken launched to solve the
                  lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
                  about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
                  programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
                  entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal
                  value. Today they do not always meet current building
                  standards and many are in need of refurbishment. The Million
                  Homes programme incorporated a large variety of technical
                  building solutions, andknowledge about former building
                  practices is needed if refurbishment is to be successful.
                  Industrialised builders in Sweden have recognized the use of a
                  platform as one means of sharing knowledge. A platform is
                  essentially the collection of assets that are shared by a set
                  of products. In a platform for housing refurbishment the
                  assets have knowledge and process content (as opposed to
                  product content) and will probably also contain many
                  relationships. The interview study carried out as part of the
                  research shows that the main purpose of a platform concept is
                  to standardize components and processes. To increase the
                  possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
                  buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should
                  be on the individuals who will actually be sharing their
                  knowledge and especially on social motivations. It is
                  important that managers and leaders demonstrate knowledge
                  sharing behaviors as this will lead to the establishment of a
                  culture where knowledge sharing is the norm; in the context of
                  this study this is especially important for the creation of an
                  efficient platform concept for refurbishment.},

                  (CEET) in recent years due to its benefits of providing an
                  engaging and immersive environment. The objective of this
                  review is to critically collect and analyze the VR
                  applications in CEET, aiming at all VR-related journal papers
                  published from 1997 to 2017. The review follows a three-stage
                  analysis on VR technologies, applications and future
                  directions through a systematic analysis. It is found that the
                  VR technologies adopted for CEET evolve over time, from
                  desktop-based VR, immersive VR, 3D game-based VR, to Building
                  Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled VR. A sibling technology,
                  Augmented Reality (AR), for CEET adoptions has also emerged in
                  recent years. These technologies have been applied in
                  architecture and design visualization, construction health and
                  safety training, equipment and operational task training, as
                  well as structural analysis. Future research directions,

                  paradigms and visualization technologies, have also been
                  provided. The findings are useful for both researchers and

                  industrial revolution and new platforms of information
                  technologies, intelligent systems have received widespread
                  attention in many industries and have brought the potential to
                  improve the efficiency of the construction industry. These
                  facts led to the appearance of a new concept in construction
                  industry called Construction 4.0. Therefore, this article
                  seeks to explore the state of implementation of Industry 4.0
                  technologies in the construction industry and analyze their
                  impact on the formation of the Construction 4.0 concept. In
                  order to achieve the aim of this article, a literature review
                  was conducted using the most relevant publication in this
                  field. Moreover, authors carried out a bibliometric analysis
                  among 195 selected research articles related to the Industry
                  4.0 and Construction 4.0 to identify interconnections between
                  these concepts. The results show that Industry 4.0 has the
                  greatest impact on productivity growth in construction and
                  that interest in digital technologies is growing every year,
                  but their penetration into the construction industry is
                  currently slow and limited. The authors suggest that further

  abstract     = {Construction is a trade where the dominating production
                  strategy is engineer-to-order. House-builders can pre-engineer
                  their design to different degrees, resulting in variations of
                  the engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order,
                  adapt-to-order, and engineer-to-stock. This variation causes
                  different settings for the use of platforms in house-building.
                  The aim of this research is to diversify the engineer-to-order
                  production strategy and its consequences for platform
                  organization by studying its use in house-building. The
                  multiple case study on four engineering/contractor firms
                  reports the core capabilities for engineer-to-order firms:
                  procurement and tendering, market knowledge, engineering,
                  multi-skilled manufacturing, and coordination of sales and
                  manufacturing. Design-to-order, adapt-to-order and engineer-to
                  stock were shown to be production strategies in use in
                  house-building. In design-to-order platforms parts of the
                  platform are undefined while engineer-to-stock platforms are
                  fully predefined. Coordination between market and
                  manufacturing is a crucial capability when engaging in
                  platform organization. When an engineering firm and a
                  contractor collaborate to fulfil client needs, the
                  coordination capability between market and manufacturing was
                  shown to be low. The case study shows that specialized
                  contractors who integrate the supply chain towards a specific
                  market segment benefit fully from the platform concept, while
                  contractors with a wider scope could focus on standardization
                  of processes rather than products.},

  abstract  = {The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing, role;
               while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts, or
               indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that, in
               large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands it
               places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as the
               proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the false
               idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or social
               critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics of
               belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he also
               questions the role of the social research within society and what
               it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It
               tackles the major issues of contemporary social research
               methodology head on and is an essential read for anyone with an
               interest in this field.},

               factories, hydroelectricity, aerospace, logistics, finance,
               scientific research and mining. The selected case studies serve
               to highlight architectural and planning innovations in industry

               fundamentally a social process. The authors maintain that

               characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral
               participation (LPP). Learners participate in communities of
               practitioners, moving toward full participation in the
               sociocultural practices of a community. LPP provides a way to

               and about their activities, identities, artefacts, knowledge and
               practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives,

                  material, with three tonnes per year used for every person in
                  the world. Twice as much concrete is used in construction as
                  all other building materials combined. There is little doubt
                  that concrete will remain in use as a construction material
                  well into the future. However, with such extensive use of the
                  material, discovery of any shortcoming or problem associated

                  construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
                  techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in
                  different fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to
                  another. This study provides a detailed discussion on the
                  development of the human capital theory under various themes
                  and sub-themes. The study further seeks to discuss the several
                  effects of human capital development on industry success and
                  competitiveness and how this contributes to economic growth in
                  developing countries. Relevant literatures on HC theory and
                  development were extracted from Scopus. Scopus is widely
                  acknowledged as one of the widest interdisciplinary databases
                  for engineering, technology, science and medicine. The Scopus
                  database features over 20, 000+ peer-reviewed journals from
                  over 5000 publishers. The Scopus database allows its users to

                  other databases such as Academic Search Complete, Art and
                  Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host, SpringerLink and Web of
                  science. The distillation of literature through thematic
                  analysis revealed the various roles of human capital and its
                  correlation with construction industry success and growth.
                  Findings from this study revealed that the success of the
                  construction industry is firmly related to the effectiveness
                  of its human capital. The study revealed that the human
                  capital theory is not without its criticisms and barriers.
                  Practically, this study explores the various benefits of human
                  capital to employers of the construction industry. The study
                  suggests that human capital development plays a key part in
                  retaining quality employees and recruiting prospects.
                  Furthermore, investment in human capital goes a long way in
                  improving employee satisfaction, organisational culture and
                  increased productivity. This study contributes to the human
                  capital discourse, which is the measure of economic value

               interpretation of American business history during the formative
               years 1870-1920, which mark the dawn of modern big business. It
               focuses on four major revolutions that ushered in this new era:
               those in power, transportation, communication, and organization.
               Using the metaphor of America as an economic hothouse uniquely
               suited to rapid economic growth during these years, it analyzes
               the interplay of key factors such as entrepreneurial talent,
               technology, land, natural resources, law, mass markets, and the
               rise of cities. It also delineates the process that laid the
               foundation for the modern era, in which virtually every human
               activity became a business, and, in most cases, a big business.
               The book also profiles numerous major entrepreneurs whose careers
               and activities illustrate broader trends and themes. It utilizes
               a wide variety of sources, including novels from the period, to
               produce a lively narrative.},

                  the analytic edge of social justice studies. Simultaneously,
                  the critical inquiry inherent in social justice research can
                  enlarge the focus and deepen the significance of grounded
                  theory analyses. Combining the two approaches enhances the
                  power of each. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all

               one book. The Fifth Edition of the bestseller Research
               Methodology has reimagined, redesigned, and fully renovated how a
               textbook can help students achieve success in their methods
               course or research project. Eight steps: Foolproof for any
               beginner researcher, the book breaks the process of designing and
               doing a research project into achievable stages. It delivers
               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't break
               over a page, making even complex concepts easier to understand.
               Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design, regular
               progress checkpoints have been built into the book and its online
               resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps, each chapter
               provides regular opportunities for students to check
               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional
               material including research articles, readings, case studies,
               activities, bibliography tools and inspiration to pursue your
               curiosity, impress your lecturer, and nail your assignments. With
               this one book, every student gets what they need to succeed. It
               is the perfect essential text for students and beginner

  abstract     = {In response to impending skills shortages and changing
                  employment patterns, the UK construction industry recently has
                  made considerable efforts to attract more women to its
                  professions. However, despite their increasing representation,
                  there are indications that women experience difficulties in
                  developing their careers within the industry. This research
                  investigated the careers of men and women working for large
                  construction companies, in order to establish the gender
                  determined influences on women's career progression. A
                  primarily qualitative methodology was employed for the
                  research, in which career profiles were developed through
                  ethnographic interviews with 41 matched pairs of male and
                  female employees. This allowed the gender specific
                  determinants of careers to be established across a range of
                  different organizations, and from informants at different
                  vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis resulted in the
                  formulation of a set of eight interrelated theoretical models,
                  from which a theory of women's career development was
                  constructed. The theory reflects the belief that the
                  construction workplace is a competitive and conflictual
                  environment, where women are overtly and covertly
                  discriminated against by men, who use structural systems to
                  undermine their participation. The women interviewed were
                  found to have dealt with these barriers in a way which
                  perpetuated existing work cultures. If reflected throughout
                  the industry, this would suggest the existence of a
                  self-fulfilling cycle of women's continued under-achievement.
                  The paper puts forward the radical proposition that women
                  should not be attracted to the industry unless steps are taken
                  to moderate its exclusionary and discriminatory culture.},

                  state where contemplated questions are of more value than
                  hasty answers. For this reason, this paper is more concerned
                  with theory formulation than theory testing. More
                  specifically, it derives a grounded theory of construction
                  crisis management which forms a useful basis for future
                  research. It does so from an investigation of the complex
                  patterns of communication and behaviour which emerge in
                  response to construction crises. The conclusion is that
                  construction crisis management is about the effective control
                  of social and behavioural instability and the conflict which
                  arises out of it. However, effective crisis management is made
                  difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms which
                  construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory also
                  is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
                  thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
                  context is identified.},

                  investigation by allowing the investigators to retain the
                  holistic and meaningful characteristics of real?life events.
                  Subsequent to data capture, data analysis will take place
                  according to the intended research methodology. However, there
                  is a potential for certain information to be hidden within the
                  data and diluted during this data analysis phase. In order to
                  minimize this and to reveal informal aspects and freshly
                  emerging themes from the case study data, it is proposed that
                  there is great value in analysing case studies on various
                  levels, through different phases using multiple methods.
                  Examples of the outcomes of applying multiple analyses
                  involving different approaches, such as grounded theory
                  methodology, rich picture diagrams and cognitive mapping, to
                  the same set of data from multiple case studies are presented
                  and discussed. This application of multiple analyses to case
                  study research of construction projects provides valuable
                  insights by revealing informal aspects and stimulating the
                  emergence of a fresh understanding of the processes and
                  interactions among different stakeholders. From the findings,
                  the limits of the formal management systems were revealed.
                  Further, the limits of tacit understanding around an evolving
                  shared vision for a project were found to be substantial
                  dimensions in understanding construction projects in a more

               Education critically analyses the specific challenges relating to
               teacher educators in the English further education (FE), such as
               the diverse nature of learners and the variety of educational
               contexts. It focuses on the journeys to becoming teacher
               educators, their relevant teaching know-how and professional
               needs. This book combines theoretical frameworks with both
               qualitative and quantitative data to outline the pathways,
               professional identities, knowledge, and continuous professional
               development of teacher educators. This data is used to discuss
               the four main themes. The first deals with the teacher educators’
               initial disciplinary areas, journey-making to be educators, and
               the current titles/positions. The next one delineates the
               know-how (knowledge, experiences, capacities and skill sets) to
               perform as teacher educators. The third one relates to their
               professional identities and the final topic, their professional
               requirements as FE teacher educators. Contributing to the field
               of further and vocational education, this book will be of great
               interest for researchers, academics, and postgraduate students in
               the field of education, specifically FE and teacher educators.},

               Education explores how practitioners in a variety of occupations
               perform their jobs and argues that working and learning are
               intricately connected. Drawing on theories around working and
               learning in informal, formal and lifelong settings, the book
               gives insights into how workers negotiate their occupational
               practices. The book investigates four related concepts – informal
               learning, practitioner inquiry, occupational education and
               epistemological perspectives. The combinations of theories and
               empirical case studies are used to provide a conceptual framework
               of inquiry where knowledge, abilities, experiences and skill sets
               play a significant aspect. It presents 11 case studies of
               professions ranging from conventional occupations of acting,
               detective work, international road transportation to emerging
               professions of boardroom consultancy, nutritional therapy and
               opinion leadership. This book will be of great interest for
               academics, scholars and postgraduate students who are engaged in
               the study of informal education, vocational education and
               occupation-related programmes. It will also offer significant

               business, medicine, education, government—and the quality of our

               that the path to success is quantifying human performance,
               publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the
               numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with
               scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to
               fixating on measuring itself—and this tyranny of metrics now
               threatens the quality of our organizations and lives. In this
               brief, accessible, and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the
               damage metrics are causing and shows how we can begin to fix the
               problem. Filled with examples from business, medicine, education,
               government, and other fields, the book explains why paying for
               measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may
               increase deaths, and much more. But Muller also shows that, when
               used as a complement to judgment based on personal experience,
               metrics can be beneficial, and he includes an invaluable
               checklist of when and how to use them. The result is an essential
               corrective to a harmful trend that increasingly affects us all.},

               Developed to complement and enhance existing course materials,
               the 100 ready-to-use activities encourage innovative and engaging
               classroom practice in seven areas: finding and using sources of
               information planning a research project conducting research using
               and analyzing data disseminating results acting ethically
               developing deeper research skills. Each of the activities is
               divided into a section on tutor notes and student handouts. Tutor
               notes contain clear guidance about the purpose, level and type of
               activity, along with a range of discussion notes that signpost
               key issues and research insights. Important terms, related
               activities and further reading suggestions are also included. Not

               number of diagnosis categories listed by the American Psychiatric
               Association has tripled in the last fifty years. With so many

               advantages, special skills, and other positive dimensions of

               algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human
               questions. Modern life is constrained by limited space and time,
               limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What
               should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much
               messiness should we accept? The authors explain how to have
               better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal
               with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others.
               From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing

                  extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities

                  foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the

                  framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing,

               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The

               first section provides an historical overview of unions and how
               they have been organized spatially. Specifically, the section
               defines and contrasts different types of unionism – craft
               unionism, industrial unionism, geographical unionism – and also
               ponders some of the spatial implications of such different models
               – unions in which decision making is highly decentralized have
               quite different geographical structures and loci of power than do
               those which are more centralized, for instance. The second
               section focuses upon how geographers have sought to investigate
               unions as geographical actors. Specifically, it addresses four
               areas of research upon which geographers have concentrated, these
               being: (1) how labor law and state regulation influence the ways

               new possibilities in architecture and construction. From the

               twentieth-century applications of offsite-produced structural
               components, cladding systems, and modular spatial units, and the
               more recent use of digitally manufactured complex-shaped building
               components, the impact of this approach has been obvious. In the

               adopted by designers or constructors to achieve better quality,
               with a reduced schedule and/or less cost. The chapter examines an
               emerging trend of near-site factories and discusses offsite
               fabrication that concentrates on prefabrication or preassembly
               approaches staged near or on site. The cost of transportation is
               an integral part of offsite fabrication that determines the
               feasibility of the specific applications. Prefabrication requires

               II, the first national building code was issued. Between 1965 and
               1975, Sweden produced a million dwellings as a result of a
               political initiative, bringing to an end the 50-year-long housing
               shortage. In 1994, the government removed all subsidiaries to
               housing construction in Sweden and for the first time in 70
               years, the housing market was governed by market forces only. The
               development of offsite construction was technology driven in
               Sweden up until 1970. When venturing into offsite construction,
               there are investments. These investments are commonly in
               production equipment and even factories, but also in personnel,
               training, and the supply chain. The lean operations strategy was

               prefabricated and modular building, in particular housing, and
               even more so the individual detached house. The ‘prefab’ house
               combines the promise of industrialised building with the dream of
               a popular mass market for architecture, and it has exercised a
               magnetism over architectural culture which is as strong today as
               it was at any point in the past. The interest originated in the
               mid-nineteenth century, but achieved a strong uptake in the early
               to mid-twentieth century, and has continued in a cyclical pattern

               information modeling has stimulated the popularity of
               prefabrication methods, the industry remains reluctant to adopt
               methods of prefabrication. One explanation is that there is
               little substantial quantifiable data to support the benefits of
               prefabrication in construction delivery. To enumerate the claims
               of prefabrication performance, there have been efforts to conduct

               the concept of montage as a driver for establishing a new
               perspective on industrially based construction. Montage holds the
               potential to unleash and introduce dynamics and tension in
               industrial architecture. The aim of introducing montage is to
               engender a new industrial conception of architecture. Off-site
               versus on-site, industry versus craft, system versus individual,
               speed versus accuracy: developments in the realm of building
               construction are frequently explained through dichotomies.
               Creating architectural dialogues between new and old, industrial
               and traditional, could provide possible answers to the latent
               industrial-oriented problems of monotonous repetition, weak
               architectural significance, neutrality and all-too-smooth
               surfaces. The inherent differences between industrial and

               and heating fuels, which were converted into energy units and
               scaled by annual production volumes. Onsite energy use was
               determined in a bottom-up fashion from the construction schedule

               as a response to World War II. The ministry of international
               trade and industry established the Japan Prefabricated
               Construction Suppliers and Manufacturers Association (JPCSMA) in
               1964 to promote best practices, develop and disseminate research,
               and form industry standards. Japan frequently experiences large
               earthquakes, which killed tens of thousands in the last
               half-century. Japanese prefabricated housing tends to be sturdy,
               even overbuilt; steel frames are used in 80 percent of
               prefabricated housing and concrete is also widely used. Japan’s
               loose enforcement of building codes, evidenced in several
               scandals, also damaged homeowners’ confidence in smaller
               builders. Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, which function
               something like states; JPCSMA data allows a nuanced understanding
               of prefabrication’s market penetration. Insulation and
               energy-efficient doors and windows may soon be required even in

               concrete, but this modular system has never achieved the
               gargantuan scale of application of Soviet panelized systems. As a

                delivered by the private sector using predominantly traditional,
                site-based, construction methods. Recently, the house-building
                industry has found itself under increasing pressure to raise
                production output to alleviate a shortage in housing supply and
                reduce house price inflation. Within this setting, there has
                been much interest in the potential offered by off-site
                construction (OSC). The production strategies employed by
                private house-building firms however, are a direct response to
                their operational environment, and the adoption of OSC would
                arguably alter the way that they deliver their developments.
                Hence, there is a clear need to understand the relationship
                between production strategy and construction methods. Based on a
                case study of one of the largest private house-building firms in
                the UK, the potential impacts of OSC on current production
                strategies have been explored. The results indicate that the
                adoption of OSC approaches may alter the manner in which
                house-building firms are able to manage their production
                process, reducing their control and restricting the very
                flexibility on which their own success relies. The findings have
                implications for the housebuilding industry, OSC manufacturers
                and construction research, given the ongoing interest in OSC as
                a means to address the UK’s housing supply issues.},

                  to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes
                  or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and
                  ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to
                  those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a
                  more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential
                  pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline

                principles they hope will command respect. Individuals, however,
                often misread situations, and many disagreements can be
                explained by people appealing, knowingly and unknowingly, to
                different principles. On Justification is the first English
                translation of Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot's ambitious
                theoretical examination of these phenomena, a book that has
                already had a huge impact on French sociology and is likely to
                have a similar influence in the English-speaking world. In this
                foundational work of post-Bourdieu sociology, the authors
                examine a wide range of situations where people justify their
                actions. The authors argue that justifications fall into six
                main logics exemplified by six authors: civic (Rousseau), market
                (Adam Smith), industrial (Saint-Simon), domestic (Bossuet),
                inspiration (Augustine), and fame (Hobbes). The authors show how
                these justifications conflict, as people compete to legitimize
                their views of a situation.On Justification is likely to spark

  abstract  = {One of the issues organizations face is identifying the required
               skills needed for a position and then evaluating whether their
               personnel have these skills or if there is a “skills gap”. The
               skills gap is the distance between the position requirements and
               the skills currently possessed by the worker in that position.
               While multiple models have been created over the years to address
               facets of the problem, none of them provide a comprehensive
               framework to clearly identify the required skills and worker
               qualifications and then evaluate the degree of similarity. A
               composite skills gap model has been developed using the Design
               Science Research Method to combine elements of previous models
               and to ensure that the resulting model met a set of established
               criteria. The Skills Gap Analysis Model (SGAM) was evaluated
               using demonstration data to ensure that it provided a single
               taxonomy for both position requirements and the worker
               qualifications, the resulting descriptions were quantifiable and
               comparable, the data was accurate and actionable, the model
               framework is adaptable to any domain, and that it is easy to use
               and not time consuming. The framework provided by the model
               establishes a theoretical foundation for skills gap analyses that
               allows for more analytical research in this area. By utilizing
               the SGAM to identify position requirements and worker
               qualifications, organizations can move personnel to better suited
               positions or utilize needed training in the specific areas
               identified. As technology moves towards increasing automation,
               robotics and artificial intelligence, this type of model can
               identify what skills are necessary for “re-tooling” the workforce
               to meet the needs to support these systems.},

               sector backed with unprecedented levels of funding from venture
               capital funds or other large investment firms. These entrants
               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new
               business model is the transformation of an existing project-based
               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new
               business models may be catalysts for potential disruption of the
               established construction sector.},

               presents a rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of
               how everyday market activity gets produced.If you’re convinced
               you know what a market is, think again. In his long-awaited
               study, French sociologist and engineer Michel Callon takes us to
               the heart of markets, to the unsung processes that allow
               innovations to become robust products and services. Markets in
               the Making begins with the observation that stable commercial
               transactions are more enigmatic, more elusive, and more involved
               than previously described by economic theory. Slicing through
               blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon presents a rigorously
               researched but counterintuitive model of market activity that
               emphasizes what people designing products or launching startups
               soon discover—the inherent difficulties of connecting individuals
               to things. Callon’s model is founded upon the notion of
               “singularization,” the premise that goods and services must adapt
               and be adapted to the local milieu of every individual whose life
               they enter. Person by person, thing by thing, Callon demonstrates
               that for ordinary economic transactions to emerge en masse,
               singular connections must be made.Pushing us to see markets as
               more than abstract interfaces where pools of anonymous buyers and
               sellers meet, Callon draws our attention to the exhaustively
               creative practices that market professionals continuously devise
               to entangle people and things. Markets in the Making exemplifies
               how prototypes, fragile curiosities that have only just been
               imagined, are gradually honed into predictable objects and
               practices. Once these are active enough to create a desired
               effect, yet passive enough to be transferred from one place to
               another without disruption, they will have successfully achieved
               the status of “goods” or “services.” The output of this more
               ample process of innovation, as redefined by Callon, is what we
               recognize as “the market”—commercial activity, at scale.The
               capstone of an influential research career at the forefront of
               science and technology studies, Markets in the Making coherently
               integrates the empirical perspective of product engineering with
               the values of the social sciences. After masterfully redescribing
               how markets are made, Callon culminates with a strong empirical
               argument for why markets can and should be harnessed to enact
               social change. His is a theory of markets that serves social
               critique.},

  abstract  = {The starting point for bringing together this collection of
               papers has been to understand workplace learning and the ways in
               which it can be enhanced. By drawing on leading edge research
               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and
               ‘communities of practice’ external to the workplace.},

               how they ought to work, and what should be done about them. He
               begins the book with an explanation of the practical features of
               constructive theorizing and shows how it mirrors general problem

  abstract     = {This article serves as an introduction to the FQS special
                  issue "Participatory Qualitative Research." In recent years
                  there has been a resurgence of interest in participatory
                  research strategies. The articles in this special issue come
                  from different disciplines. Against the background of concrete
                  empirical research projects, they address numerous conceptual
                  considerations and methodological approaches. After reading
                  the contributions, and engaging with the authors' arguments,
                  we were prompted to focus in particular on those areas in
                  which further work needs to be done. They include, on the one
                  hand, fundamental principles of participatory research, such
                  as democratic-theory considerations, the concept of "safe
                  space," participation issues, and ethical questions. And, on
                  the other hand, we focus on practical research considerations
                  regarding the role and tasks of the various participants;
                  specific methodological approaches; and quality
                  criteria—understood here in the sense of arguments justifying
                  a participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a broad
                  discussion that does not focus only on participatory research
                  in the narrower sense. Because participatory methodology poses
                  certain knowledge- and research-related questions in a radical
                  way, it has the potential to draw attention to hitherto
                  neglected areas in qualitative methodology and to stimulate
                  their further development.},

                  current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
                  construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
                  Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
                  administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
                  about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
                  towards training. The survey intended to address the following
                  research questions, specifically in relation to the
                  construction industry. Findings – The survey results reveal
                  that whilst overall participation in workplace training is
                  high, the current workplace training environments do not
                  foster balanced skill development. The study reveals that in
                  the current absence of a formal and well-balanced training
                  mechanism, construction workers generally resort to their own
                  informal self-development initiatives to develop the needed
                  role-specific theoretical knowledge. Research
                  limitations/implications – The findings of the research are
                  based on the data primarily collected in the construction
                  industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are limited to a
                  single Tier 2 construction company. Practical implications –
                  The findings of this study can be utilised to suggest
                  improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
                  training initiatives. Social implications – The research
                  suggests that workplace training has positive relationship
                  with career growth. The results suggest that in the
                  construction industry, employees are generally well aware of
                  the importance of workplace training in their career
                  development and they largely appreciate training as being a
                  critical factor for developing their capacity to perform their
                  roles successfully, and to maintain their employability.
                  Originality/value – This paper is unique as it investigates
                  the current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within
                  the construction industry in Queensland, Australia. So far no
                  work has been undertaken to identify and discusses the main
                  method of workplace learning within the Tier 2 industry in the
                  context of Queensland Australia.},

  abstract     = {This study tests a number of predictions about the
                  effectiveness of four different strategies for teaching three
                  to four year old children how to master a difficult
                  construction task. These strategies were derived from previous
                  studies of mother-child and experimenter-child interactions in
                  an assisted learning situation. One strategy the 'contingent
                  approach' was based primarily on theoretical considerations
                  and when used in earlier work as a basis for describing and
                  evaluating maternal teaching it enabled us to predict how well
                  children taught by their mothers would do with a task after
                  instruction. The three other strategies are idealised versions
                  of the teaching methods used by less successful
                  mothers-as-teachers. On the basis of our analysis of effective
                  instruction it is possible to predict how well children taught
                  by these four different techniques by a trained instructor
                  should perform after instruction.The present study largely
                  confirms these predictions. In so doing, it strengthens the
                  supposition that it was maternal behaviour in the earlier work
                  which influenced the children's task abilities and it also
                  corroborates various hypotheses about the essential nature of
                  effective face-to-face instruction.},

  abstract      = {Disruptive technologies offer avenues to significantly
                   improve the performance of construction project delivery.
                   While the construction industry is often labeled as
                   conservative and unimaginative with regard to technology
                   adoption, significant strides have been made in recent years
                    specifically, the use of Building Information Modeling
                   (BIM) for information storage, distribution and
                   communication, as well as Lean construction techniques such
                   as production planning and control (PPC). While the
                   implementation of these innovative technologies and practices
                   individually improve project performance, integrating them
                   together can provide still greater benefits. BIM is certainly
                   useful, but it alone is not a satisfactory answer to the
                   paradox: how does one design and visualize a 3D product in a
                   2D space? Augmented Reality (AR) is a disruptive technology
                   that can help address this challenge. AR is both an
                   aggregator of information and an information publishing
                   platform which allows users a spectrum of capabilities to 1)
                   passively view displayed information, 2) actively engage and
                   interact with published content, and 3) collaborate with
                   others in real time from remote locations. No extant research
                   effort has comprehensively investigated the opportunities and
                   benefits of the integrated use of AR, BIM, and Lean in the
                   planning process to improve project performance. This paper
                   addresses precisely this research gap. Using insights gained
                   from real-world construction projects, this paper examines
                   the current state of production strategy process (PSP)
                   development  an integral part of PPC, identifies pain-points
                   and opportunities for process re-engineering using AR, and
                   develops an AR-enabled PSP future state.},

                  Using a Vygotskian framework it is claimed that in different
                  ways vocational knowledge is shaped by history, community and
                  ontogeny through microgenetic development. This process of
                  ongoing problem?solving links social circumstances to the
                  development of cognitive structures necessary to conduct
                  vocational practice. It is held that such findings help
                  explain the limitations of transfer and also the need to
                  conceptualise expertise at the particular community of

  abstract     = {To meet the requirements of an increasingly innovative and
                  competitive environment, workers need to continuously develop
                  and maintain competence. Consequently, initial vocational
                  education and training should prepare (future) workers by
                  providing a basis for lifelong learning in developing both
                  routine and flexible competence. The question is whether
                  workplace learning in initial VET contributes to this aim. To
                  describe WPL processes and outcomes in the Dutch senior VET
                  context, we apply a further elaboration of a comprehensive
                  workplace learning theory, comprising a cognitive, a social
                  and an emotional dimension. Qualitative case studies show that
                  various factors in the different dimensions of learning
                  influence the learning processes and outcomes in a diverse
                  way. Especially more profound acquisition and development of
                  abstract principles relating to flexible competence does not
                  automatically take place during WPL. To fulfill the
                  expectations regarding the role of initial VET to contribute
                  to learning to learn and lifelong learning, improvements are

                  hitherto received only limited attention. Our study explores
                  employers? experiences in organizing internships, and their
                  collaboration with one University of Applied Sciences, through
                  data from social and health care employers (n=165), collected

                  improved as a means of learning from work experience, issues
                  that employers want to raise within the collaborative
                  framework require attention. These themes include relations
                  with students, curriculum issues and the organization of the
                  collaboration. A problem related to underestimating employer
                  views on developing internships?is that the resource-intensive
                  nature of collaborative relations is silenced. As a result,
                  targets for developing partnerships are left unrecognized,

                  requirements of vocational practice and its manifestations in
                  actual practice need to be accounted for in curriculum goals
                  and content. Currently, curriculum frameworks for vocational
                  programs focus on the socio-cultural level of practice (e.g.
                  national competencies, national skills standards). Yet, these
                  fail to account for the actual manifestations and requirements
                  of the vocational practice and how judgements are made about
                  performance. An emphasis on practice as a basis for
                  considering curriculum goals and developing adaptable outcomes
                  is proposed.},

               crises, the policies that could fix them and the politics

               or, more accurately, multiple housing crises. A massive housing
               shortage in major cities has resulted in skyrocketing rents. Low-
               and middle-income individuals find themselves priced out of the
               places with the most opportunity. Homelessness is rampant in
               cities across the country. Developers often face the steepest
               obstacles to building in the places where new housing is needed
               most. And young people are increasingly viewing homeownership,
               once a vital part of the American dream, as hopelessly out of
               reach. These outcomes weren’t inevitable. Plenty of other
               countries supply their populations with high-quality housing at
               lower prices. And the solutions here are incredibly simple: Build
               more housing in places where it’s needed, build cheaper forms of
               housing, build housing alongside public transit, provide more
               housing vouchers. So why don’t we act on them?},

               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and

  abstract  = {Summary This chapter discusses the challenge of increasing the
               responsivity of vocational education. Responsivity is defined as
               the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to
               interpret socioeconomic and technological developments for
               curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical approach.
               VET needs to equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and
               confidence to engage in work and make a difference in the
               transformation of work. This chapter argues that learners have to
               be provided with opportunities to actively engage in innovation
               at work to experience what is needed to deal with uncertainty and
               to organize their own learning in such circumstances. In the
               Netherlands, the challenges of building regional networks and
               participating in regional innovation are being taken up by higher
               professional education (HPE). This chapter describes the
               promising approach developed in the Netherlands, which focuses on
               innovative work-based learning to strengthen responsivity.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the relationship between the way work is
                  organised, the organisational context, and learning in the
                  workplace. It develops, in part, from earlier work where we
                  argued that organisations differ in the way they create and
                  manage themselves as learning environments, with some
                  conceptualised as expansive in the sense that their employees
                  experience diverse forms of participation and, hence, are more
                  likely to foster learning at work (see Fuller and Unwin,
                  2004). The paper argues that contemporary workplaces give rise
                  to many different forms of learning, some of which is utilised
                  to the benefit of the organisation and employees (though not,
                  necessarily, in a reciprocal manner), but much of which is
                  buried within everyday workplace activity. By studying the way
                  in which work is organised (including the organisation of
                  physical and virtual spaces), it is possible to expose some of
                  this learning activity as well as examples of the creation of
                  new (or refined) knowledge. Part of this process involves the
                  breaking down of conceptual hierarchies that presuppose that
                  learning is restricted to certain types of employee and/or
                  parts of an organisation. This paper builds on the work of
                  other researchers who highlight the importance of the context
                  (see, inter alia, Nonaka et al, 2005; Boreham and Morgan,
                  2004; Unwin et al 2005). It also draws on the work of
                  Engestrom (see, inter alia, 2001), who has highlighted the way
                  new knowledge is created through employee interaction when
                  problem solving and, hence, has paid attention to the
                  important question of the quality of learning in the
                  workplace. In addition, it builds on Wilkinsons (2002)
                  conceptualisation of the way organisations construct, manage
                  and respond to social relations of production that operate at
                  a variety of levels in productive systems. The paper uses
                  evidence from the learning as work project, which is based in
                  public and private sector organisations in the UK.},

  abstract  = {In 2021, its Diamond Jubilee year, the Association of British
               Theatre Technicians (ABTT) undertook to revise Theatre Buildings:
               A Design Guide (Routledge, 2010). This new edition (Routledge,
               2023) has substantially re-written text with fresh images and
               entirely new reference projects, providing essential guidance for
               all those engaged in the design of theatre buildings. Edited by
               Margaret Shewring (Emeritus Reader, University of Warwick, former
               Director of the Postgraduate Diploma and MA in Theatre
               Consultancy), this new publication is written by a team of
               international experts, architects, theatre consultants,
               acousticians, engineers and industry professionals led by Tim
               Foster (Foster Wilson Size) and Robin Townley (CEO of the ABTT).
               It provides an invaluable resource for those looking to build,
               remodel or conserve theatre buildings, taking into account the
               significant changes which have taken place in the last twelve
               years in all aspects of theatre design and technical practice. It
               locates those changes in the wider context of the need for
               sustainability in the theatre industry in response to the climate
               emergency, inclusivity, diversity of access, placemaking and
               concerns for health and wellbeing. This new edition provides
               guidance for anyone who seeks inspiration and encouragement to
               create or improve a place of entertainment or who seeks to
               understand what might be required to accommodate an audience for
               the presentation of live performance and the successful use,
               operation and organisation of such a venue. Its generous format
               and the thirty-two new reference projects, more than 260
               high-resolution colour images and 175 diagrams and specially
               commissioned plans make it accessible and informative both to the
               general reader and the professional specialist.},

                  imposes restrictions on the flexibility of the product
                  offering when developing design standardisation. How design
                  process standardisation incorporates variations in products
                  has not been widely studied. The aim of this research is to
                  explain how design breakdown enables Lean Product Development
                  Flow (LPDF) and look-ahead planning in an industrialised
                  house-building context where an open platform is used. A case
                  study was conducted of how one of the leading industrialised
                  house-building companies in Sweden introduced the LPDF tool
                  Knowledge Innovation/Visual Planning (KI-VP) into their design
                  process. The implementation of KI-VP led to an increased
                  cross-functional understanding of relationships between
                  activities, which are an important factor in achieving
                  flexibility and a synchronised workflow. By using design
                  standardisation, look-ahead planning was implemented and used
                  in the management of design flow. Standardisation through
                  design breakdown provides a basis for knowledge innovation
                  that enables improvement of the open platform using a
                  bottom-up approach and increases the production flow.},

                  automation and other types of technological changes on labor
                  demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over
                  the recent past. At the center of our framework is the
                  allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of
                  production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor
                  in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content
                  of production against labor because of a displacement effect.
                  As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in
                  value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises
                  productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by
                  the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative
                  advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task
                  content of production in favor of labor because of a
                  reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and
                  labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task
                  content of production—due to automation and new tasks—can be
                  inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition
                  suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last
                  three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the
                  displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker
                  reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than
                  in previous decades.},

               resource development (HRD) that many contemporary managers and
               trainers would naturally refer to or even consider using as they
               seek ways in which to build workforce capacity. It can be
               dismissed as an anachronism in the light of the emergent
               discourse about the so-called knowledge economy and knowledge
               workers, as well as calls for greater occupational boundary
               crossing and multi-disciplinary/multi-skilled approaches to work.
               Knowledge workers are presumed to enter the workplace fully
               formed, armed with theoretical knowledge and (possibly) some work
               experience from their university degrees. In contrast,
               apprenticeship is positioned within an initial vocational
               education and training (IVET) paradigm and as a journey towards
               intermediate level expertise. Hence, for some, apprenticeship is
               an institutional arrangement between the state, employers and
               (sometimes) trades unions to train young people. For others,
               apprenticeship has echoes of a medieval world of individual
               craftsmen (sic), such as carpenters, goldsmiths and stonemasons
               who earned a living from their skills and formed guilds to

                  become increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence
                  techniques in order to develop more personalized educational
                  systems. These systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring
                  systems (ITSs). This paper focused on the variant
                  characteristics of ITSs developed across different educational
                  fields. The original studies from 2007 to 2017 were extracted
                  from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Google scholar, Embase,
                  Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 53 papers
                  were included in the study based on inclusion criteria. The
                  educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer sciences
                  (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data mining,
                  and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
                  frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
                  intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
                  enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction,
                  evaluate learners, define and update the learner’s model, and
                  classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of
                  the system, learner’s performance, and experiences were used
                  for evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user
                  interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning
                  in the learning process, these systems have rarely been
                  applied in experimental courses including problem-solving,
                  decision-making in physics, chemistry, and clinical fields.
                  Due to the important role of a cell phone in facilitating
                  personalized learning and given the low rate of using
                  mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development
                  and evaluation of mobile-based ITSs.},

                 (TUIs) can positively impact learning. Alleged benefits include
                 increased usability, improved engagement and collaboration
                 among students, and enhanced perception of tasks, particularly
                 spatial ones. However, little empirical data exists to support
                 these claims. Moreover, despite their potential benefits for
                 learning, TUIs remain scarcely used in schools. This thesis
                 explores these issues within the specific context of vocational
                 education and training for carpenter apprentices. The learning
                 objectives focus on spatial skills, particularly the mapping
                 between 2D and 3D representations. We examine (1) whether TUIs
                 can support the training of spatial skills and, if so, what
                 features enable them to do so, and (2) what kinds of classroom
                 pedagogical scenarios TUIs can support. This research follows a
                 design-based approach and includes empirical studies, primarily
                 conducted in classroom settings.},

               representation, form and space. The aim of this book is to
               provide teachers, students, practising architects and general
               readers with a set of ideas that will enrich their conversation,
               their writing, and above all their thinking about architecture.
               The book is divided into eight chapters, each covering a
               particular aspect of architecture, and introduces difficult
               concepts gradually. Architectural theorists and philosophers are
               mentioned in passing and their works are listed in the
               bibliography, but they are not the subject of the book.
               Architecture, rather than philosophy, is at the centre of the
               picture. The aim is to enable the reader to understand
               architecture in all its aspects, rather than to learn the names
               of particular theorists. Written in a conversational style,
               Thinking about Architecture is an invaluable and accessible
               standard introduction to architectural theory.},

               a powerful attack on the intellectual origins of totalitarianism.
               An immediate sensation when it was first published, Karl Popper’s
               monumental achievement has attained legendary status on both the
               Left and Right. Tracing the roots of an authoritarian tradition
               represented by Plato, Marx, and Hegel, Popper argues that the
               spirit of free, critical inquiry that governs scientific
               investigation should also apply to politics. In a new foreword,
               George Soros, who was a student of Popper, describes the

               it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an
               explanation that makes it appear less random, and more
               predictable, than it was. Why do we not acknowledge the
               phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the
               answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn
               specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We
               concentrate on things we already know and time and time again
               fail to take into consideration what we don't know. We are,

               stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready? In the year
               2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really
               feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual
               world where most of humanity spends their days. When the
               eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of
               fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of
               decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his
               vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself. Then Wade cracks
               the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take
               this prize. The race is on—and the only way to survive is to win.

               and form. Past approaches no longer sustain new demands and
               require innovative thinking. The need for a new outlook is
               propelled by fundamental changes that touch upon environmental,
               economic and social aspects. The depletion of non-renewable
               natural resources and climate change are a few of the
               environmental challenges. Increasing costs of material, labor,
               land and infrastructure have posed economic challenges with
               affordability being paramount among them. Social challenges are
               also drawing the attention of designers, builders and homeowners.
               Walkable communities, aging in place and multigenerational living
               are some of the concepts considered. In addition, live-work
               environments have become part of the economic reality for those
               who wish to work from home—which has become possible through
               digital advances.},

               Magazine's top 100 non-fiction books written in English since
               1923. Reissued with a fresh Introduction by the Nobel-prize
               winner Paul Krugman and a new Afterword by Keynes’ biographer
               Robert Skidelsky, this important work is made available to a new
               generation. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
               transformed economics and changed the face of modern
               macroeconomics. Keynes’ argument is based on the idea that the
               level of employment is not determined by the price of labour, but
               by the spending of money. It gave way to an entirely new approach
               where employment, inflation and the market economy are concerned.
               Highly provocative at its time of publication, this book and
               Keynes’ theories continue to remain the subject of much support
               and praise, criticism and debate. Economists at any stage in
               their career will enjoy revisiting this treatise and observing

               advantage. Performance gains can be achieved through cost saving,
               process improvement or technology adoption, but the biggest
               difference is made by people. This means that recruiting,
               engaging and retaining the very best talent has never been more
               important.Crucially, these employees should be a diverse group of
               people with different approaches, skills and strengths in
               problem-solving and driving innovation. As well as focusing on
               gender, race, age and class, it is critical that businesses also
               develop a neurodiverse workforce if they are committed to
               outperforming the competition and achieving sustainable business
               growth.Neurodiversity at Work is a practical guide that explains
               what neurodiversity is, why it's important and what the benefits
               are. It covers how to attract, recruit and engage neurodiverse
               talent and provides guidance on how to adapt HR policies,
               processes and workplaces to ensure that all employees, including
               the 2 in 10 employees in the UK who are neurodiverse, can reach
               their full potential. Neurodiversity at Work is packed full of
               case studies from leading organizations like Microsoft who are
               already seeing the productivity, performance and financial
               benefits of neurodiversity in the workplace. Individuals in these
               companies are also experiencing benefits in their working
               environments. Also featured are interviews with prominent figures
               in the neurodiversity community and people who have successfully
               adapted their HR processes for neurodiversity, including members
               of the ND@IBM Program and the Head of People and Culture at

               relationship between buildings and energyThe story of
               architecture is the story of humanity. The buildings we live in,
               from the humblest pre-historic huts to today's skyscrapers,
               reveal our priorities and ambitions, our family structures and
               power structures. And to an extent never explored until now,
               architecture has been shaped in every era by our access to
               energy, from fire to farming to fossil fuels.In this
               ground-breaking history of world architecture, Barnabas Calder
               takes us on a dazzling tour of some of the most astonishing
               buildings of the past fifteen thousand years, from Uruk, via
               Ancient Rome and Victorian Liverpool, to China's booming
               megacities. He reveals how every building - from the Parthenon to
               the Great Mosque of Damascus to a typical Georgian house - was
               influenced by the energy available to its architects, and why
               this matters.Today architecture consumes so much energy that 40\%
               of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from the
               construction and running of buildings. If we are to avoid
               catastrophic climate change then now, more than ever, we need
               beautiful but also intelligent architecture, and to retrofit -
               not demolish - the buildings we already have.},

               President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and Chief
               Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank, headed
               international commissions for the UN and France, and was awarded

               public intellectual whose numerous books on vital topics have
               been best sellers. What brought him to economics were his
               concerns about the inequality and discrimination he saw growing
               up. Wanting to understand what drives it and what can be done
               about it has been his lifelong passion. This book gathers
               together and extends to new frontiers this lifelong work, drawing
               upon the challenges and insights of each of these phases of his
               career. In a still very widely cited paper written fifty years
               ago, Stiglitz set forth the fundamental framework for analyzing
               intergenerational transfer of wealth and advantage, which plays a
               central role in persistent inequality. That and subsequent work,
               developed most fully here for the first time, described today's
               inequality as a result of centrifugal forces increasing
               inequality and centripetal forces reducing it. In recent decades,
               the centrifugal forces have strengthened, the centripetal forces
               weakened. His general theory provides a framework for
               understanding the marked growth in inequality in recent decades,
               and for devising policies to reduce it. A central message is that
               ever-increasing inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is, in a
               fundamental sense, a choice. Stiglitz explains that inequality
               does not largely arise from differences in savings rates between
               capitalists and others, though that may play a role (as Piketty,
               Marx, and Kaldor suggest); but rather, it originates importantly
               from the rules of the game, which have weakened the bargaining
               power of workers as they have increased the market power of
               corporations. He also explains how monetary authorities have
               contributed to increasing wealth inequality, and how, unless
               something is done about it, likely changes in technology such as
               AI and robotization will make matters worse. He describes
               policies that can simultaneously reduce inequality and improve
               economic performance.},

                 human well-being and provides a foundation for other rights,
                 including rights to health, education, water and sanitation,
                 freedom of association and freedom of expression, and the right
                 to life itself. It is one of the underlying key capabilities,
                 which Amartya Sen argues is required for opportunities to be
                 harnessed (Sen 1985). The United Nations has determined that
                 the right to adequate housing should not be interpreted
                 narrowly, such as being limited to having shelter or viewed
                 exclusively as a commodity, but rather it is to be understood
                 in a far broader sense: the right to live in peace, security
                 and dignity (UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
                 Rights 1991). Realising this right in practice, however,
                 requires new thinking and new policies. The stark reality is
                 that we are a long way from achieving this goal. Our paper
                 suggests that to make this ambition real, we must bring a human
                 rights approach together with new economic thinking and
                 mission-oriented—outcomes-driven— economic policies. These
                 frameworks can reinforce one another. While the former invokes
                 legal accountability for ensuring adequate housing for all in
                 support of human flourishing, the latter organises and
                 accelerates the multi-stakeholder, whole-of-government action
                 required to meet this obligation. The United Nations
                 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving ‘access for all
                 to adequate, safe and affordable housing’ (SDG 11.1) can
                 provide a north star orientation for this new policy approach.
                 But achieving it requires unpicking the relationships between
                 current actors. It requires governments to set bold missions
                 that catalyse cross-sectoral investment and collaboration, to
                 embrace their role as market-shapers, to align public sector
                 tools, institutions and finance with these missions, and to
                 design partnerships – including with the private sector – that
                 prioritise human rights and the common good.},

               more domains, leveraging rapid advances in other technologies and
               driving soaring stock prices. Yet measured productivity growth
               has declined by half over the past decade, and real income has
               stagnated since the late 1990s for most Americans. We describe
               four potential explanations for this clash of expectations and
               statistics: false hopes, mismeasurement, redistribution and
               implementation lags. While a case can be made for each
               explanation, we argue that lags have likely been the biggest
               contributor to the paradox. The most impressive capabilities of
               AI, particularly those based on machine learning, have not yet
               diffused widely. More importantly, like other general purpose
               technologies, their full effects won’t be realized until waves of
               complementary innovations are developed and implemented. The
               adjustment costs, organizational changes, and new skills needed
               for successful AI can be modeled as a kind of intangible capital.
               Some of the value of this intangible capital is already reflected
               in the market value of firms. However, going forward, national
               statistics could fail to measure the full benefits of the new

                 exploring the relationship between three different practices to
                 improve product development: Concurrent Engineering (CE), New
                 Product Development (NPD), and Project Management (PM). The
                 literature on each approach is abundant, yet studies explaining
                 their inter-relationship are scanty and contradictory.
                 Therefore, the main contribution of this thesis is explanation
                 and clarification of contradictory theories and perspectives.
                 In exploring this relationship four cases studies were
                 developed in companies that were applying these practices.
                 Principles of the grounded theory and qualitative research were
                 applied to gather and analyse data. The results suggest that
                 CE, NPD, and PM are relatively different in practice and
                 purpose and therefore they can be complementary to each other.
                 However, because of a lack of clearer definitions and
                 boundaries they are sometimes considered competing approaches,
                 as has been observed both in the literature and in practice.
                 CE, NPD, and PM were difficult to perceive as a sub-component
                 one of the other as has been suggested in the literature.
                 Rather, inter-linked process models seemed to better explain
                 how the inter-relationship was understood and applied. The data
                 gathered from the case studies suggest cause-effect
                 relationships that may guide practitioners to implement or
                 improve their product development practices. The investigation
                 explores the essence, purpose and the knowledge generation
                 process of CE, NPD and PM. It is suggested that NPD has a
                 higher level of maturity than CE and NPD. This suggestion and
                 the corresponding discussion is thought to be a contribution of
                 current philosophical debates on the subject areas thereby
                 nurturing the research agenda.},

                 (PMS) to monitor their performance, assess the success of
                 strategies, and/or assist the implementation of change
                 programmes for continuous improvement. Performance measurement
                 research has significantly evolved from developing conceptual
                 frameworks (e.g. balanced scorecard) to rethinking and
                 verifying the effects of PMS that is contextualised within the
                 organisation. Inspite of significant evolution, PMS remains
                 contentious conceptually and challenging for practitioners,
                 especially in construction where theory and practice face
                 contextual opportunities and constraints. While the approaches
                 of key performance indicators (KPIs) and project performance
                 benchmarks are predominating in construction research and
                 practice, a systematic investigation of the conceptual basis of
                 PMS is lacking in the construction context. This research
                 examines the challenges for PMS theory and practice.
                 Specifically, it aims to provide theoretical verification and
                 convincing evidence pertaining to the extent to which key
                 attributes of PMS lead to any positive effects in the
                 construction context. By conducting a mixed methods research
                 (i.e. a questionnaire survey and three case studies in UK
                 construction firms), this study finds: three attributes are
                 crucial for explicitly anatomising PMS – the nature, process
                 quality and the use; all of them can separately lead to
                 positive effects on sustaining project management and financial
                 performance of construction firms, whereas PMS process quality
                 plays a predominant role; both the nature of PMS and PMS
                 process quality are the prerequisites of the extant use of PMS,
                 which further improves system users’ perceived effectiveness of
                 PMS; and finally, both institutional and organisational
                 contexts largely shape and affect the adoption of PMS (the
                 nature and process quality in particular). This study primarily
                 contributes to systematically explicating the conceptual basis
                 and effectiveness of PMS in the construction context and
                 thereby uncovering the black box of how PMS affects
                 organisational performance in general.},

                 management research. However, in the field of construction
                 project management, it is relatively under-explored. This is
                 mainly due to the different organisational context of Temporary
                 Multi-Organisations (TMOs). This research re-explores the
                 notion of organisational culture in construction projects.
                 Based on Darwin’s theory of evolution this research goes back
                 to the very beginning; illustrating the exact meaning and
                 dynamics of organisational culture in a construction TMO’s
                 ecosystem. This research view an organisation and its forming
                 of culture(s) as part of an evolutionary process. Thus, a
                 critical realist’ view of causation is used as the foundation
                 of the research design and methodology. Case study materials
                 are provided from three Alliancing TMOs belonging to two major
                 infrastructure clients in the UK. A designer culture model and

                 employed through semi-structured interviews and pre- and
                 post-interview meetings. Other supporting documentations are
                 also consulted. Three propositions and a postulate are
                 generated and examined against the empirical data. Findings
                 suggest that (i) the TMOs’ culture evolves through a set of
                 recursive stages across the project lifecycle, (ii) the culture
                 of the TMO undergoes several lifecycles during one lifespan of
                 the project, and (iii) there are some evidence that culture at
                 TMO level is learned, rationalised and routinised at corporate
                 level. The postulate shows that it is plausible to predict the
                 trajectory of how a TMO’s culture will evolve across the
                 project lifecycle given a set of organisational features. In
                 practice, findings suggest that hard artifacts alone are not
                 able to sustain established culture throughout the projec},

                 suggests corresponding reliance on psychological stimulus in
                 the decision making processes (Slovic et al, 2003). The
                 prevailing construction management research publications
                 however appear limited in exploring the psychology behind the
                 intuitive risk identification and treatment processes. The
                 purpose of this study therefore was to address the resulting
                 data gap by drawing upon theories from systems thinking and
                 behavioural science in examining the behavioural patterns of
                 intuitive construction risk management decision making systems,
                 in the context of the sources and structure of risk

                 tools and techniques from different systems of thinking and
                 decision making. The empirical findings from a four case

                 evidence in support of the three research theoretical
                 propositions: risk perception categorisation within the
                 construction project delivery system reflecting the structure
                 of the differentiated specialist roles; psychological
                 difficulties associated with intuitive risk identification of
                 events outside the scope of our heuristics; incompatibilities
                 of mixing decision processing approaches and data presentation
                 formats from different systems of thinking and decision making.
                 The study has also made recommendations for future research

                 tasked with both delivering projects and managing operational
                 assets. Greater awareness of the owner and their supply network
                 capabilities to mitigate failure could reduce significant
                 quality costs that can amount to many millions of pounds. This
                 thesis investigates why assets handed over to the owner have
                 failed during operation, and proposes new ways that
                 capabilities can be integrated to reduce and prevent potential
                 operational failure from arising. An abductive reasoning with a
                 grounded theory approach was used over a three-year period, and
                 involved quarterly expert research steering group meetings to
                 validate the iteration between literature and empirical
                 observation to obtain new insights. The first workshop and
                 questionnaire phase of the study created a Cost of Quality
                 (COQ) framework; this was then tested on five multi-case study
                 and subsequently developed within a single expert owner
                 organisation using semi-structured interviews, card sorting and
                 a Delphi review. The results show that the owner and the
                 multi-organisational supply network capabilities are fragmented
                 in addressing operational failure. By identifying and measuring
                 quality cost failure, owners and their supply network will
                 learn and be able to procure more integrated capabilities in
                 failure mitigation for reducing quality cost failure. This will
                 be achieved with better understanding of the relationship
                 between owner’s strategic requirement, technical project
                 delivery and functional operations management capabilities,
                 which is summarised in a capabilities cycle model. The model
                 illustrates the need for a strategic project and quality
                 management approach to integrate capabilities within each phase
                 of a project’s lifecycle. An integrated capabilities approach
                 is proposed for the owner and its multi-organisational supply
                 and operator network to integrate and collaborate in relation
                 to the capabilities required to equally share project risk and

  abstract    = {Managing large infrastructure projects remains a thorny issue
                 in theory and practice. This is mainly due to their
                 increasingly interconnected, interdependent, multilateral,
                 nonlinear, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and rapidly changing
                 nature. This study is an attempt to demystify the key issues to
                 the management of large construction projects, arguing that
                 these projects are delivered through networks that evolve in
                 ways that we do not sufficiently understand as yet. The
                 theoretical framework of this study is grounded in Complexity
                 Theory; a theory resulted in a paradigm shift when it was first
                 introduced to project management post-2000 but is yet to be
                 unpacked in its full potential. The original contribution of
                 the study is predicated on perceiving large construction
                 projects as evolving complex systems that involves a high
                 degree of self‐organisation. This is a process that transitions
                 contractually static prescribed roles to dynamic network roles,
                 comprising individuals exchanging information. Furthermore, by
                 placing great emphasis upon informal communications, this study
                 demonstrates how self-organising networks can be married with
                 Complexity Theory. This approach has the potential to make
                 bedfellows around the concept of managing networks within a
                 context of managing projects; a concept that is not always
                 recognised, especially in project management. With the help of
                 social network analysis, two snapshots from Bank Station
                 Capacity Upgrade Project Network were analysed as a case study.
                 Findings suggest that relationships and hence network
                 structures in large construction projects exhibit small-world
                 topology, underlined by a high degree of sparseness and
                 clustering. These are distinct structural properties of
                 self-organising networks. Evidence challenges the theorisation
                 about self-organisation which largely assumes positive outcomes
                 and suggests that self-organising could open up opportunities
                 yet also create constraints. This helps to provide further
                 insights into complexity and the treatment of uncertainty in
                 large projects. The study concludes with detailed
                 recommendations for research and practice.},

                 the construction of hospitals is based on designs established

                 integration – where traditional procurement with Design, Bid,
                 Build delivery was combined with standards and guidance; (2)
                 dysfunctional integration – where the adoption of Private
                 Finance Initiative (PFI) with Design and Build delivery
                 transferred traditional roles and reduced standardisation; (3
                 and 4) adaptive integration 1 and 2 – which saw both a gradual
                 deregulation of standards; and, an understanding for standards,
                 and (5) the fifth temporal disintegration period – where
                 guidance from the wider delivery model ceased to be updated due
                 to top down policy reorganisation and lack of centralised
                 control and includes a current case study. Throughout these
                 temporal periods, it was found that the national delivery
                 models have had a significant influence on hospital project
                 delivery and particularly systems of systems integration. A new
                 model based on layering principles that shows the impact of

                 address complexity and uncertainty that emerge in project
                 operations. Amongst various built environment innovations,
                 Building Information Modelling (BIM) is prominently chosen by
                 the built environment organisations. This innovation presents a
                 great challenge for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).
                 It renders existing working paradigms obsolete and digitally
                 transforms built environment businesses. The lack of
                 individuals with adequate BIM competence is a major problem.
                 Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a potential solution. This
                 research aims to investigate BIM learning in projects in the
                 built environment SMEs. The study examines knowledge practices
                 used in projects and how they are exercised together in forming
                 a project-based learning mechanism of BIM. 31 designers and
                 engineers from the British and the Thai design and engineering
                 SME consultancies are interviewed. Knowledge practices are
                 identified based on their significance, while associations
                 between them are analysed. Informal meeting, Knowledge team
                 creation, and Standardisation play a crucial role in BIM
                 learning in projects. Informal meeting and Knowledge team
                 creation relate to tacit knowledge learning and exploration.
                 Standardisation encourages explicit knowledge learning and
                 exploitation. A project-based learning mechanism of BIM is
                 formed through an interconnected system of knowledge practices.
                 The connections among knowledge practices are found as
                 assistive and correlative. The project-based learning
                 mechanisms of BIM identified within this research are
                 ambidextrous through the variety of knowledge practices being
                 exercised together. Additionally, they can be further
                 categorised as Exploitative, Ambidextrous, and Explorative.
                 Practical suggestions are provided for BIM managers to increase
                 attention towards the employment of certain knowledge practices
                 and the creation of project-based learning mechanisms of BIM.
                 Informal meeting, Knowledge team creation, and Standardisation
                 are recommended for managers of BIM and other innovations.
                 Innovation managers can balance ambidexterity by utilising an
                 array of knowledge practices to encourage both exploitation and
                 exploration. Proactive and tangible support such as the
                 implementation of guidelines and protocols from the public
                 sector in developing countries will promote BIM learning in
                 organisations and encourage industry-wide adoption.},

                 from daily activities to the appraisal of big infrastructure
                 projects. Building upon the underlying constructs of this
                 behaviour through the lenses of support and prospect theories,
                 operationalised in the internal and external view in the
                 project management context, helped me to formulate a conceptual
                 framework. This framework, called the “Holistic view” suggests
                 ways to integrate the two perspectives with the aim to improve
                 the quality of forecasts in infrastructure management.
                 Integration can be achieved by including subjective
                 probabilities and unpacking techniques into case-based
                 reasoning methods. Based on this framework and on the analysis
                 of the relevant policies, perspectives, definitions and
                 techniques provided by the literature on optimism bias in
                 project forecasting, I designed and administered four
                 experiments, with a sample of 231 participants. The results of
                 the first experiment show that there is a positive relationship
                 between different levels of dispositional optimism and resource
                 overruns. In the second experiment, I found that adding an
                 optimism uplift to an estimate structurally increases forecast
                 precision, however, this might lead to the use of more
                 resources than when optimism uplift is not applied. In the
                 third experiment, I found that unpacking, whilst making
                 estimations slightly more precise, does not influence the
                 estimations as in the previous case, but only the estimator.
                 The results of the fourth experiment, combining unpacking with
                 optimism uplift, indicated that forecast precision starkly
                 increased, supporting the adoption of an “Holistic view”. This
                 research shows the relevance of experimental methods in project
                 management, unveils new relationships between different
                 perspectives in the project forecasting field, and analyses,

  abstract    = {Countries are trying to expand their healthcare capacity
                 through advanced construction, modular innovation, digital
                 technologies and integrated design approaches such as Design
                 for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA). Within the context of
                 China, there is a need for stronger implementation of digital
                 technologies and DfMA, as well as a knowledge gap regarding how
                 digital-enabled DfMA is implemented. More critically, an
                 integrated approach is needed in addition to DfMA guidelines
                 and digital-enabled approaches. For this research, a mixed
                 method was used. Questionnaires defined the context of
                 Huoshenshan Hospital, namely the healthcare construction in
                 China. Then, Huoshenshan Hospital provided a case study of the
                 first emergency hospital which addressed the uncertainty of
                 COVID-19. This extreme project, a 1,000-bed hospital built in
                 10 days, implemented DfMA in healthcare construction and
                 provides an opportunity to examine the use of modularity. A
                 workshop with a design institution provided basic facts and
                 insight into past practice and was followed by interviews with
                 18 designers, from various design disciplines, who were
                 involved in the project. Finally, multiple archival materials
                 were used as secondary data sources. It was found that
                 complexity hinders building systems integration, while
                 reinforcement relationships between multiple dimensions of
                 modularity (across organisation-process-product-supply chain
                 dimensions) are the underlying mechanism that allows for the
                 reduction of complexity and the integration of building
                 systems. Promoting integrated approaches to DfMA relies on
                 adjusting and coupling multi-dimensional modular reinforcement
                 relationships (namely, relationships of modular alignment,
                 modular complement, and modular incentive). Thus, the building
                 systems integrator can use these three approaches to increase
                 the success of digital-enabled DfMA.},

  abstract    = {Large, or mega, construction project organisations are
                 temporary in nature and traditionally structured around a life
                 cycle model consisting of predefined, time bound sequential
                 stages of work that are designed to process information and
                 reduce uncertainty. Yet as organising through projects becomes
                 both more prevalent and challenging, it could be argued that
                 such a model constrains our understanding and representation of
                 what ‘actually’ happens beyond these deterministic structures
                 and prescriptive routines, specifically in understanding ‘how’
                 construction project organisations transition through the
                 predefined time boundaries of the sequential stages. This
                 thesis contributes to this knowledge by identifying an
                 alternative image of the life cycle model through empirically
                 investigating the ‘transition’ between life cycle stages, with
                 ‘incomplete’ information. It identifies a five stage ‘recursive
                 process model of transitioning’ that highlights the underlying
                 generative mechanisms involved in the (re)creation of
                 organisational routines in managing the incompleteness
                 associated with transitioning from one life cycle stage to the
                 next. It presents an empirical autoethnographic case study over
                 one year, observing a construction project organisation as it
                 sought to transition from its design stage, through formal
                 sanction, and into its construction stage. Informed
                 ontologically by process metaphysics, and through challenging
                 the underlying theoretical temporal assumptions of temporary
                 organisations - ‘newness’, and organisational routines -
                 ‘repetition’, it describes managing project transitions as
                 ‘dialogical action’, influenced by the spatiotemporal aspects
                 of the organising inquiry. It identifies the patterning of
                 action within six transition routines, that when mapped over
                 time present the five stage recursive process model of
                 transition. Despite a successful three-year relationship in
                 developing organisational capability between the client and the
                 contractor in the design stage, as the pre-defined date for the
                 commencement of the construction stage neared, there emerged a
                 realisation of the impending uncertainty that this new stage
                 would bring. Triggered by various formal and informal
                 transition ‘rituals’, the organisations’ search for, and
                 assumptions about the ‘sufficient completeness’, or ‘necessary
                 incompleteness’ of information led to both the effortful and
                 emergent (re)creation in the ‘patterning of dialogic action’
                 from the design stage, into the construction stage.},

                 analysis and visualisation of reforms in procurement and
                 project management systems within the UK construction industry.
                 The subject matter chosen was inspired by the publication of
                 the Latham Report (Latham, 1994) and personal experience within
                 the construction industry within one of the roles currently in
                 transition. Certain limitations within existing methodologies
                 employed by those who have sought to analyse construction
                 procurement and management (for example, Higgin and Jessop,
                 1965; Masterman, 1992; Franks, 1998 and Cleland and King,
                 1983), are identified. These limitations are associated with
                 the interdependence of roles, appropriateness of detail,
                 uniformity of presentation and the difficulty of quantification
                 in the context of a non-linear, complex, iterative,
                 interactive, non-hierarchical process that construction
                 comprises. Conceptually the research draws together Winch's
                 model of the construction project team as a temporary project
                 coalition (Winch, 1983:36) and Williamson's nexus of treaties
                 (in Aoki, 1992:1). The research proposes that current dramatic
                 changes in procurement and management strategies might be
                 observed and analysed if the construction project is
                 conceptualised as a network of relationships existing between
                 the firms that comprise the project coalition. These
                 relationships are contractual, those associated with
                 performance incentives and those associated with information
                 exchanges (the latter classified into the main functions that
                 the project team must perform - design development, cost and
                 progress management). It is proposed that social network
                 analysis (SNA) be used to investigate these networks. Following
                 a pilot study involving the BAA "Genesis" project, four case
                 studies were carried out. Two control studies involved
                 traditional procurement; a further two represented projects
                 utilising partnering, supply chain management and work
                 clusters, and involving two of the UK's largest and most
                 innovative clients. Analysis of the data focussed upon the use
                 of centrality (a measure of prominence within a network), as a
                 means of quantifying changing roles within the coalition and
                 the relationships between the firms providing these roles. The
                 research established that SNA is a very effective tool for
                 research into procurement and management. Findings suggest that
                 the changing prominence of existing roles and the evolution of
                 certain hybrid roles are readily quantified and graphically
                 represented using SNA; centrality is ideally suited to look
                 into the leverage that project actors exert within the
                 construction project supply chain; findings challenge some
                 existing views on the desirability and nature of fragmentation
                 within the UK construction industry; findings also suggest that
                 the two new procurement projects deal with the governance of
                 their respective coalitions in very different ways; a single,
                 prominent actor is needed to manage the supply chain;
                 traditional construction roles are changing rapidly - cost
                 management, design dislocation and the new role of cluster
                 leader are all important issues.},

                  productivity growth between 1983 and 1986. This higher rate of
                  productivity growth was sufficient to bring these businesses
                  up to the labor productivity levels of comparable businesses
                  by 1986. The positive effects of training implementation on

                  with a common production technology in a narrowly defined
                  industry - valve manufacturing - to study the effects of new

                  eliminate many sources of unmeasured heterogeneity that could

                  In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the
                  work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
                  broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data
                  on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset
                  of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between
                  users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available

                  people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information

                  is performing are providing information and assistance,

               What if you stopped trying to do everything, so that you could
               finally get round to what counts?We're obsessed with our
               lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, the struggle
               against distraction, and the sense that our attention spans are
               shrivelling. Still, we rarely make the connection between our
               daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management
               problem: the question of how best to use our ridiculously brief
               time on the planet, which amounts on average to about four
               thousand weeks. Four Thousand Weeks is an uplifting, engrossing
               and deeply realistic exploration of the challenge. Rejecting the
               futile modern obsession with 'getting everything done,' it
               introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by
               embracing rather than denying their limitations. And it shows how
               the unhelpful ways we've come to think about time aren't
               inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we've made, as
               individuals and as a society. Its many revelations will transform
               the reader's worldview. Drawing on the insights of both ancient
               and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual
               teachers, Oliver Burkeman sets out to realign our relationship
               with time - and in doing so, to liberate us from its
               tyranny.Embrace your limits. Change your life. Make your four

                  Effective implementation of CIM is shown to require an
                  appreciation of the social and organizational issues

                  is doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is
                  happening? In Construction Management and Economics and
                  elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars
                  on the topic of innovation in construction – but what of
                  transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so –
                  how? We set out with this Special Issue to answer these
                  questions and advance the theoretical understanding of the
                  transformation of the built environment, and how this requires
                  the construction industry to transform accordingly. We believe
                  that a “transforming construction” research agenda entails a
                  multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on
                  industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and
                  project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise
                  the process focus in contemporary social science through our
                  framing of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by
                  seeking out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice.
                  This resulting Special Issue will hopefully act as a
                  provocation for new perspectives on transforming construction:
                  it attempts to revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we
                  conceptualise both construction and construction research. The
                  eight papers build on a strong legacy of research on
                  innovation in construction management, while providing new
                  insights on what is being transformed and how; locating,
                  albeit tentatively, where the future debates are; and
                  identifying spaces where rich data may be found. Readers will
                  find a stimulating range of conceptual thinking and empirical
                  evidence being brought to bear on change, innovation, and
                  transformation, with extensive discussion of implications for
                  future research on construction policy, projects, and people,
                  broadening our field of view and drawing out strong new ideas
                  to guide practice. The structure of this Editorial is as
                  follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of key themes
                  within the transforming construction topic, as outlined in the
                  Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the content of the
                  eight accepted papers, positioning each paper under one of
                  three headings, which reflect the multi-scale perspective of
                  the Special Issue and as presented previously in the Call for
                  Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in which we set
                  out what we see as five major themes emerging from the papers,
                  characterising what transforming construction looks like from
                  the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion
                  section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most
                  pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some
                  direction to future research in the area, followed by a short
                  commentary on some limitations of the Special Issue.},

  abstract     = {Construction is traditionally a trade that produces unique,
                  one-off products designed specifically for individual projects
                  via an engineer-to-order process. However, recently developed
                  flexible product platforms based on the theory of mass
                  customisation offer product flexibility with affordable costs.
                  The degree of commonality between products can also be
                  increased by applying the products-in-products concept. This
                  study aims to conceptualise and test theories of mass
                  customisation through modularisation for applications in the
                  construction industry. Three case studies on building and
                  infrastructure construction projects using different
                  specification processes (modify-to-order, configure-to-order
                  and select-variant) are presented. The results show that the
                  products-in-products concept is useful for enabling mass
                  customisation in construction. While select-variant
                  specification is compatible with relatively integral designs,
                  the architecture must have a modular structure to enable
                  modify-to-order or configure-to-order customisation.},

                 workers. Skills learned on the job contribute 46 percent of the
                 average person’s lifetime earnings, and companies that build
                 human capital are more likely to propel their employees into
                 higher earnings brackets over the course of a career. Building
                 human capital also pays off for firms in the form of more
                 consistent earnings and greater resilience during crisis. In
                 addition to being more consistent than their sector peers,
                 human capital builders are better at retaining talent, with
                 attrition rates that are about 5 percentage points lower. Some

  abstract    = {In 1966, the philosopher Michael Polanyi observed, "We can know
                 more than we can tell... The skill of a driver cannot be
                 replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar;
                 the knowledge I have of my own body differs altogether from the
                 knowledge of its physiology." Polanyi's observation largely
                 predates the computer era, but the paradox he identified--that
                 our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our
                 explicit understanding--foretells much of the history of
                 computerization over the past five decades. This paper offers a
                 conceptual and empirical overview of this evolution. I begin by
                 sketching the historical thinking about machine displacement of
                 human labor, and then consider the contemporary incarnation of
                 this displacement--labor market polarization, meaning the
                 simultaneous growth of high-education, high-wage and
                 low-education, low-wages jobs--a manifestation of Polanyi's
                 paradox. I discuss both the explanatory power of the
                 polarization phenomenon and some key puzzles that confront it.
                 I then reflect on how recent advances in artificial
                 intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the
                 likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.
                 A key observation of the paper is that journalists and expert
                 commentators overstate the extent of machine substitution for
                 human labor and ignore the strong complementarities. The
                 challenges to substituting machines for workers in tasks
                 requiring adaptability, common sense, and creativity remain
                 immense. Contemporary computer science seeks to overcome
                 Polanyi's paradox by building machines that learn from human
                 examples, thus inferring the rules that we tacitly apply but do
                 not explicitly understand.},

               growth, damages the environment, and promotes long commutes,
               traffic jams, misery, and smog. Yet instead of a serious focus on
               the issue, America’s cities feature niche conversations about the
               availability of “affordable housing” for poor people. Yglesias’s

               pandemic, to defend ourselves against global threats—it is
               faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital
               age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome
               than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap
               between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get. But it’s
               not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a
               rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy
               from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the
               details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as
               they cascade through a complex hierarchy. But there is an
               approach taking hold that keeps pace with today’s world and
               reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve.
               Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must stop trying to move the
               government we have today onto new technology and instead consider
               what it would mean to truly recode American government.},

                  of early career professional learning, which focused on the
                  first three years of employment of newly qualified nurses,
                  graduate engineers seeking chartered status and trainee
                  chartered accountants. The first section introduces the
                  theoretical and methodological base provided by previous
                  projects, then proceeds to explore an epistemology of
                  practice, using three dimensions: (1) four key elements of
                  practice—situational assessment, decision‐making, actions and
                  meta‐cognitive monitoring; (2) the mode of cognition and its
                  dependence on time and prior learning; and (3) the context,
                  its influence on mode of cognition and its affordances for
                  learning. The central section presents the project’s findings
                  on modes of learning through a new framework, which divides
                  learning processes according to whether the object is
                  perceived to be learning or working, then adds a list of
                  shorter learning activities used within both types of process,
                  including various types of mediating artifact. The final
                  section summarises the project’s findings on factors affecting
                  learning, then draws practical conclusions from the project’s
                  work.},

               with earlier editions, the Sixth Edition is virtually a new
               volume, with 27 of the 34 chapters representing new topics or
               approaches not seen in the previous edition, including
               intersectionality; critical disability research; postcolonial and
               decolonized knowledge; diffraction and intra-action; social media
               methodologies; thematic analysis, collaborative inquiry from the

               co-production and the politics of impact; publishing qualitative
               research; and academic survival. Authors in the Sixth Edition
               engage with questions of ontology and epistemology, the politics
               of the research act, the changing landscape of higher education,
               and the role qualitative researchers play in contributing to a
               more just, egalitarian society.},

  abstract  = {In How Progress Ends, Carl Benedikt Frey challenges the
               conventional belief that economic and technological progress is
               inevitable. For most of human history, stagnation was the norm,
               and even today progress and prosperity in the world’s largest,
               most advanced economies—the United States and China—have fallen
               short of expectations. To appreciate why we cannot depend on any
               AI-fueled great leap forward, Frey offers a remarkable and
               fascinating journey across the globe, spanning the past 1,000
               years, to explain why some societies flourish and others fail in
               the wake of rapid technological change. By examining key
               historical moments—from the rise of the steam engine to the dawn
               of AI—Frey shows why technological shifts have shaped, and
               sometimes destabilized, entire civilizations. He explores why
               some leading technological powers of the past—such as Song China,
               the Dutch Republic, and Victorian Britain—ultimately lost their
               innovative edge, why some modern nations such as Japan had
               periods of rapid growth followed by stagnation, and why planned
               economies like the Soviet Union collapsed after brief surges of
               progress. Frey uncovers a recurring tension in history: while
               decentralization fosters the exploration of new technologies,
               bureaucracy is crucial for scaling them. When institutions fail
               to adapt to technological change, stagnation inevitably follows.
               Only by carefully balancing decentralization and bureaucracy can
               nations innovate and grow over the long term—findings that have
               worrying implications for the United States, Europe, China, and
               other economies today. Through a rich narrative that weaves
               together history, economics, and technology, How Progress Ends
               reveals that managing the future requires us to draw the right
               lessons from the past.},

               is, how value is created, and how the economy distributes that
               value. In particular, the authors observe that after the Great
               Recession of 2007–2008, many measures of economic health (such as
               GDP, corporate profits, and investment in equipment and software)
               rebounded quickly, while unemployment lagged behind, which they
               attribute to technology eliminating the need for many forms of
               human labor. Examples of technology they point to are robotics,
               numerically controlled machines, computerized inventory
               management software, speech recognition, speaker recognition,
               language translation, self-driving vehicles, pattern recognition
               and online commerce. The authors write that businesses are
               increasingly substituting machines for people, and that rate at
               which digital technologies are advancing is exponentially higher
               than that of the organizations, institutions, and individuals
               within our economy. Additionally, the corporate use of equipment
               and software is increasing faster than the rate of employment.},

  abstract  = {Rifkin uncovers a paradox at the heart of capitalism that has
               propelled it to greatness but is now taking it to its death—the
               inherent entrepreneurial dynamism of competitive markets that
               drives productivity up and marginal costs down, enabling
               businesses to reduce the price of their goods and services in
               order to win over consumers and market share. (Marginal cost is
               the cost of producing additional units of a good or service, if
               fixed costs are not counted.) While economists have always
               welcomed a reduction in marginal cost, they never anticipated the
               possibility of a technological revolution that might bring
               marginal costs to near zero, making goods and services priceless,
               nearly free, and abundant, and no longer subject to market
               forces. Now, a formidable new technology infrastructure—the
               Internet of things (IoT)—is emerging with the potential of
               pushing large segments of economic life to near zero marginal
               cost in the years ahead. Rifkin describes how the Communication
               Internet is converging with a nascent Energy Internet and
               Logistics Internet to create a new technology platform that
               connects everything and everyone. Billions of sensors are being
               attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity
               grid, logistics networks, recycling flows, and implanted in
               homes, offices, stores, vehicles, and even human beings, feeding
               Big Data into an IoT global neural network. Prosumers can connect
               to the network and use Big Data, analytics, and algorithms to
               accelerate efficiency, dramatically increase productivity, and
               lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of
               products and services to near zero, just like they now do with
               information goods. The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a
               hybrid economy—part capitalist market and part Collaborative
               Commons—with far reaching implications for society, according to
               Rifkin. Hundreds of millions of people are already transferring
               parts of their economic lives to the global Collaborative
               Commons. Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling IoT and making
               and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy,
               and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost. They are also
               sharing cars, homes, clothes and other items via social media
               sites, rentals, redistribution clubs, and cooperatives at low or
               near zero marginal cost. Students are enrolling in free massive
               open online courses (MOOCs) that operate at near zero marginal
               cost. Social entrepreneurs are even bypassing the banking
               establishment and using crowdfunding to finance startup
               businesses as well as creating alternative currencies in the
               fledgling sharing economy. In this new world, social capital is
               as important as financial capital, access trumps ownership,
               sustainability supersedes consumerism, cooperation ousts
               competition, and "exchange value" in the capitalist marketplace
               is increasingly replaced by "sharable value" on the Collaborative
               Commons. Rifkin concludes that capitalism will remain with us,
               albeit in an increasingly streamlined role, primarily as an
               aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to
               flourish as a powerful niche player in the coming era. We are,
               however, says Rifkin, entering a world beyond markets where we
               are learning how to live together in an increasingly
               interdependent global Collaborative Commons.},

               Times'Deep work' is the ability to focus without distraction on a
               cognitively demanding task. Coined by author and professor Cal
               Newport on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you
               better at what you do, let you achieve more in less time and
               provide the sense of true fulfilment that comes from the mastery
               of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our
               increasingly competitive economy.And yet most people, whether
               knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creatives
               struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go
               deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and
               social media, not even realising there's a better way.A mix of

               reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung
               building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a
               social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to
               Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and
               surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most serious
               professionals should quit social media and that you should
               practice being bored. Put simply: developing and cultivating a
               deep work practice is one of the best decisions you can make in
               an increasingly distracted world. This book will point the way.},

  abstract  = {Cal Newport's clearly-written manifesto flies in the face of
               conventional wisdom by suggesting that it should be a person's
               talent and skill - and not necessarily their passion - that
               determines their career path. Newport, who graduated from
               Dartmouth College (Phi Beta Kappa) and earned a PhD. from MIT,
               contends that trying to find what drives us, instead of focusing
               on areas in which we naturally excel, is ultimately harmful and
               frustrating to job seekers.The title is a direct quote from
               comedian Steve Martin who, when once asked why he was successful
               in his career, immediately replied: "Be so good they can't ignore
               you" and that's the main basis for Newport's book. Skill and
               ability trump passion. Inspired by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs'
               famous Stanford University commencement speech in which Jobs
               urges idealistic grads to chase their dreams, Newport takes issue
               with that advice, claiming that not only is thsi advice
               Pollyannish, but that Jobs himself never followed his own
               advice.From there, Newport presents compelling scientific and
               contemporary case study evidence that the key to one's career
               success is to find out what you do well, where you have built up
               your 'career capital,' and then to put all of your efforts into

                  study of the origins of technology-skill complementarity in
                  manufacturing. We offer evidence of the existence of
                  technology-skill and capital-skill (relative)
                  complementarities from 1909 to 1929, and suggest that they
                  were associated with continuous-process and batch methods and
                  the adoption of electric motors. Industries that used more
                  capital per worker and a greater proportion of their
                  horsepower in the form of purchased electricity employed
                  relatively more educated blue-collar workers in 1940 and paid
                  their blue-collar workers substantially more from 1909 to
                  1929. We also infer capital-skill complementarity using the
                  wage-bill for non-production workers and find that the
                  relationship was as large from 1909-19 as it has been
                  recently. Finally, we link our findings to those on the
                  high-school movement (1910 to 1940). The rapid increase in the
                  supply of skills from 1910 to 1940 may have prevented rising
                  inequality with technological change.},

  abstract     = {Fictional medical programs are often used for more than just
                  their recreational enjoyment; they can also influence career
                  decision making. Very little research has examined the
                  pedagogical value of fictional medical programs in terms of
                  their motivational value in the choice of a nursing career. As
                  such, the aim of this study was to examine what motivated
                  nursing students to choose nursing careers, if fictional
                  medical programs were motivators, and if they are used by
                  students as a learning tool. The cross-sectional study
                  collected data using a questionnaire and occurred between
                  April and June 2018. The findings were generated from
                  students' short answers and extended responses within the
                  questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive and
                  inferential statistics, while qualitative data were analysed
                  thematically. A total of 291 students participated (82.6\%
                  response rate), with motivations for entering nursing being
                  similar to other international studies; however, as
                  motivators, fictional medical television programs were rated
                  higher than job security. Overall, students engage with
                  medical television programs along a television-learning
                  continuum, ranging from limited watching time, recognising
                  inaccuracies, understanding dialogue, through to using
                  fictional medical television programs as tools for learning.
                  However, this is dependent on time, interest, current level of
                  understanding, and a program's perceived value.},

               misses—the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world
               is transformed by the Internet and the near-infinite choice it
               offers consumers, so traditional business models are being
               overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and
               how they want to get it. Chris Anderson first explored the Long
               Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the
               most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this
               eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new
               economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going
               and exploring the huge opportunities that exist for new
               producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates
               how long-tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy
               business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the
               rules for operating in a long-tail economy. And he provides a

  abstract  = {If a country wants to remain economically vibrant, it needs to
               manufacture things. In recent years, however, many nations have
               become obsessed with making money out of selling services,
               leaving the real business of manufacturing to others. Makers is
               about how all that is being reversed. Over the past ten years,
               the internet has democratized publishing, broadcasting, and
               communications, leading to a massive increase in the range of
               participation in everything digital—the world of bits. Now the
               same is happening to manufacturing—the world of things. Chris
               Anderson, bestselling author of The Long Tail, explains how this
               is happening: how such technologies as 3D printing and
               electronics assembly are becoming available to everybody, and how
               people are building successful businesses as a result. Whereas
               once every aspiring entrepreneur needed the support of a major
               manufacturer, now anybody with a smart idea and a little
               expertise can make their ideas a reality. Just as Google,
               Facebook, and others have created highly successful companies in
               the virtual world, so these new inventors and manufacturers are
               assuming positions of ever greater importance in the real world.

  abstract  = {Why do we use eighty-year-old metrics to understand today's
               economy? The ways that statisticians and governments measure the
               economy were developed in the 1940s, when the urgent economic
               problems were entirely different from those of today. In The
               Measure of Progress, Diane Coyle argues that the framework
               underpinning today's economic statistics is so outdated that it
               functions as a distorting lens, or even a set of blinkers. When
               policymakers rely on such an antiquated conceptual tool, how can
               they measure, understand, and respond with any precision to what
               is happening in today's digital economy? Coyle makes the case for
               a new framework, one that takes into consideration current
               economic realities. Coyle explains why economic statistics
               matter. They are essential for guiding better economic policies;
               they involve questions of freedom, justice, life, and death.
               Governments use statistics that affect people's lives in ways
               large and small. The metrics for economic growth were developed
               when a lack of physical rather than natural capital was the
               binding constraint on growth, intangible value was less
               important, and the pressing economic policy challenge was
               managing demand rather than supply. Today's challenges are
               different. Growth in living standards in rich economies has
               slowed, despite remarkable innovation, particularly in digital
               technologies. As a result, politics is contentious and democracy
               strained. Coyle argues that to understand the current economy, we
               need different data collected in a different framework of
               categories and definitions, and she offers some suggestions about
               what this would entail. Only with a new approach to measurement
               will we be able to achieve the right kind of growth for the
               benefit of all.},

  abstract     = {This article contends that deskilling is best understood not
                  as a distinct phenomenon, but as a component of a process Marx
                  (1993: 694) called ‘absorption’. Absorption involves not only
                  the extraction of capacities from labour but also their
                  implementation in machines. The article reads Braverman’s
                  (1998) analysis of Taylorism as a demonstration of how
                  absorption entails a specific labour process of its own, which
                  I call the absorption process. The nature of the absorption
                  process is contingent on many social factors. This article
                  focuses on a technical factor: the particular machines used to
                  implement captured skills and knowledge, called here the
                  infrastructure of absorption. Since technological capacities
                  are ever-evolving under capital due to the continual
                  revolutionizing of the means of production, infrastructures of
                  absorption change over time and this necessitates new
                  absorption processes. Braverman (1998: 132) pointed to a
                  qualitative change in absorption with the digital computer,
                  which he described in terms of a new ‘universality of the
                  machine’. While Braverman rightly pointed out the computer as
                  a novel infrastructure, he did not discern qualitative changes
                  to the absorption process, seeing instead the extension of
                  Taylorist processes of capture of knowledge and skill. I
                  contend that a qualitative shift has become apparent since the
                  rise of machine learning in around 2015. Machine learning
                  enables a different absorption process of emergence which does
                  not require the codification of captured knowledge. Much
                  labour process theory (LPT) (and adjacent) research presumes
                  that deskilling and automation operate in terms of a process
                  of capture, however, I show that emergence presents
                  qualitatively different means for both. I suggest that the
                  infrastructure of machine learning presents the possibility of
                  task-agnostic automation.},

                  procrastination or a lack of ideas, but of knowing how to
                  start: what kind of sentence belongs at the beginning of a

                  difficult to implement in scientific writing, where the ideas

                 yet faces persistent challenges including low productivity,
                 limited technological adoption, and a critical shortage of
                 skilled labor. As the sector embraces offsite construction and
                 digitalization, new skills and training models are required.
                 Traditional vocational education pathways have not evolved to
                 meet these needs. This research investigates how workers in
                 industrialized and offsite construction environments acquire
                 and apply new competencies through workplace learning, aiming
                 to bridge the gap between vocational education and the rapidly
                 changing demands of the modern construction industry.},

               when he stays safely in his own study at home, he can't contain
               his curiosity about the world around him. "A Short History of
               Nearly Everything" is his quest to find out everything that has
               happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization—how we got
               from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill
               Bryson's challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the
               pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry, and particle
               physics, and see if there isn't some way to render them
               comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be
               interested in science. It's not so much about what we know, as
               about how we know what we know. How do we know what is in the
               center of the Earth, or what a black hole is, or where the
               continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure
               these things out? On his travels through time and space, he
               encounters a splendid collection of astonishingly eccentric,
               competitive, obsessive, and foolish scientists, like the
               painfully shy Henry Cavendish, who worked out many conundrums,
               like how much the Earth weighed, but never bothered to tell
               anybody about many of his findings. In the company of such
               extraordinary people, Bill Bryson takes us with him on the
               ultimate eye-opening journey, and reveals the world in a way most
               of us have never seen it before.},

  abstract     = {In the scientific literature, it is highlighted that
                  industrialized construction has significant comparative
                  advantages over traditional construction, primarily in four
                  indicators: (i) cost reduction, (ii) time reduction, (iii)
                  increased energy performance, and (iv) reduced environmental
                  impacts. However, there is no certainty about the range of
                  variation of these indicators for these comparative
                  advantages, creating uncertainty about the real impact of
                  industrialized construction. In this work, through a
                  systematic literature review based on PRISMA, 90 articles that
                  met the selection criteria related to the four mentioned
                  indicators were selected and analyzed. The results show that
                  industrialized construction has comparative advantages over
                  traditional construction but with a wide spectrum of variation
                  in each of the indicators. In the cost indicator, reductions
                  between 7\% and 50\% and increases between 26\% and 72\% are
                  observed; in time, reductions between 9\% and 50\% and
                  increases up to 32\% are recorded, and reductions in energy
                  demand between 20\% and 90\% are also reported. For the
                  environmental indicators, data were only provided for projects
                  in the design stage or for construction solutions on a scale,
                  demonstrating the need to obtain indicators in the operational
                  stage. It is concluded that although industrialized
                  construction offers significant advantages, it is essential
                  that new construction solutions consider contextual
                  variations, initial investment, logistical challenges, and
                  specialized labor to maximize their benefits.},
